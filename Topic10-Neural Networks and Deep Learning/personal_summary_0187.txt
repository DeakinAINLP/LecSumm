Learning Summary Topic 9 covers the non-linear models and related topics; the following are the main points:  1.  Bagging and Boosting:  Bagging (bootstrap aggregation) and boosting, two popular ensemble techniques, are explained in the topic 9 learning. Bagging is intended to improve stability and accuracy while reducing variance and mitigating overﬁ(cid:427)ng. Meanwhile, boosting primarily reduces bias and can transform weak learners into strong ones.  2.  Random Forests:  The topic 9 learning provides a thorough understanding of Random Forests, an ensemble learning method that works by constructing a large number of decision trees. It explains how each decision tree in the forest makes a prediction and then chooses the most common prediction as the ﬁnal output. Out-of-bag (OOB) errors and feature importance in Random Forests are also covered in the course. It introduces the concept of majority voting, in which each algorithm in the ensemble makes a prediction (vote), and the ﬁnal prediction is determined based on the results of these votes.  3.  Advanced Topics:  Topic 9 learning delves into advanced topics such as determining feature importance using Random Forests and ensemble learning techniques such as Voting Classiﬁer and Stack Classiﬁer. It describes how these techniques combine the predictions of diﬀerent classiﬁers to provide a ﬁnal prediction.  4.  Random Forest in Python:  A practical session on implementing a Random Forest in Python using the Titanic dataset is included in the topic 9 learning. It shows how to conﬁgure the number of decision trees (n estimators) and the tree's depth (max depth), among other things.    5.  Boosting with Python:  AdaBoost, a boosting method that combines weak learners to form a strong one, is introduced in topic 9 learning. It also includes a useful Python implementation of AdaBoost.
