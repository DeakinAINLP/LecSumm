This topic covered the topic of ensemble learning, which involves combining multiple models to improve overall prediction accuracy. The main types of ensemble learning discussed were bagging and boosting. Bagging involves training multiple models independently on different subsets of the data and then aggregating their predictions. Bootstrap estimation was introduced to randomly sample from the data to create these subsets. Boosting, specifically AdaBoost, was also covered, which involves iteratively training weak models on reweighted versions of the data to improve overall performance. The benefits and drawbacks of these methods were discussed, as well as some practical considerations for implementation.
