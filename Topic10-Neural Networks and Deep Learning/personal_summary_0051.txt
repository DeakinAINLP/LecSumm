During topic nine of the course, we focused on supervised learning, which mainly on Random forest. The lecture covered the importance of understanding reducing the variance using random forest. It also delved into we can train multiple decision trees, each with slightly different subsets of data. We also learned about the sci-kit processes in  Python,  which  can  be  used  to  implement  Random  forest  on  train  data  and evaluation on test data and use of hyperparameters to get best performance. Overall, the lecture provided a deep understanding of Random forest.
