Ensemble Learning Techniques   The ensemble method is a technique to reduce the variance of unstable machine  learning methods, such as decision trees.   The idea is to train multiple decision trees on different subsets of data, which  are obtained by random sampling with replacement from the original data set. Bootstrapping or bootstrap sampling.   The final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of the individual machine learning method (e.g decision trees) for regression, or by taking the majority vote for classification.   3 common methods of ensemble learning are:   Bagging (Bootstrap aggregating): It trains multiple models on different subsets of the  data and averages their predictions.   Boosting: It trains multiple models sequentially, each one correcting the errors of the  previous one, and weights their predictions.   Stacking Generalisation: It trains multiple models on the same data and uses another model to learn how to best combine their predictions, to improve prediction accuracy.  Random Forest Algorithm   The random forest algorithm is based on the idea of bagging, which is a technique to  reduce the variance of a single decision tree by averaging multiple trees.   To create a random forest, we need to specify two parameters:   T, the number of trees in the forest,  m, the number of features to consider(or try) at each split. Usually the square root of the #total  features.   To implement the random forest algorithm. For each tree in the forest, we do the  following steps:  Draw a bootstrap sample of the data, which ensures that each tree is trained on a different  subset of the data.   Grow a fully grown decision tree with no pruning, for splitting each node, randomly select m features out of the total number of features, and choose the best split among them based on some criterion (such as entropy or gini index).   To make a prediction for a new instance, Aggregate the predictions of these trees for that  instance by taking the mean (for regression) or the majority vote (for classification).   To evaluate the performance of the random forest, we can use the out-of-bag (OOB) error, which is an estimate of the generalization error based on the instances that were not used for training each tree. The OOB error is equivalent to using a validation or test set.  Factors affecting the Performance of the Random Forest Algorithm Output   The number of trees (T) in the forest:   This parameter controls the trade-off between bias and variance of the ensemble  model.   A larger T reduces the bias by averaging more independent trees, but it also increases  the risk of overfitting if the trees are too similar.   A smaller T reduces the variance by using subsets of features in different trees, but it  also increases the bias if the trees are too weak.   The number of features (m) used at each split.   This parameter controls the correlation (lower is better) and strength (higher is  better) of the individual trees.   A larger m increases the strength of each tree by allowing more information to be  used at each split, but it also increases the correlation between the trees by making them more similar.   A smaller m decreases the correlation by introducing more randomness and diversity in the feature selection, but it also decreases the strength of each tree by limiting the information available at each split.  Feature Importance   Feature importance measures how each feature decrease  the weighted impurity (Gini or entropy) of tree.   A feature is more important if it splits the nodes of the tree  into purer subsets of the target class.   Feature importance can be calculated by averaging the impurity decrease over all the trees in a random forest.   Feature importance can be used to select the most relevant features for prediction or interpretation.  Boosting Algorithms   Boosting: It trains multiple models sequentially, each one correcting the errors of the previous one, and weights their predictions based on their performance, so that the final prediction is a weighted average of the individual predictions.  Adaboost (Adaptive boost)  a classification algorithm: The steps of Adaboost algorithm are:  - Initialize the weights of all examples to be equal and normalized. - For each iteration, train a weak learner on the weighted dataset and calculate its error rate. - If the error rate is zero or greater than 0.5, stop the algorithm. - Otherwise, calculate the weight of the weak learner based on its error rate and update the weights of the examples accordingly. - Return the final ensemble as a weighted average of the weak learners.  Gradient boost: This algorithm trains weak learners on the residuals of the previous weak learners, i.e., the difference between the true labels and the predicted labels. By doing so, it tries to reduce the bias of the ensemble and fit the data more closely. The steps of gradient boost are:  - Initialize a constant model as the first weak learner. - For each iteration, calculate the residuals of the current ensemble and train a weak learner on them. - Update the ensemble by adding the weighted weak learner to it. - Return the final ensemble as a sum of the weak learners.  XGBoost (extreme gradient descent): This algorithm is an optimized version of gradient boost that uses several techniques to improve its speed and performance, such as parallelization, regularization, tree pruning, missing value handling, etc. It also supports various types of objectives and evaluation metrics, making it suitable for different kinds of problems. The steps of XGBoost are similar to gradient boost, but with some modifications and enhancements.  Stacked Generalisations   Stacked generalisation is a technique for combining multiple models  to improve prediction accuracy.   Voting Classifier:  An ensemble learning technique called a voting  classifier combines the predictions of various separate classifiers to provide a final prediction.   Stack Classifier: Another ensemble learning technique that aggregates the predictions of various separate classifiers.   Stack regression: A method for forming linear combinations of  different predictors (regression & trees) to give improved prediction accuracy.
