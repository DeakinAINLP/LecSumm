Ensemble learning Ensemble learning refers to the process of combining multiple models, such as classifiers or experts, to solve a computational intelligence problem. This approach is used when a single model may be weak or inaccurate, and by leveraging the collective decision-making of multiple models, better performance can be achieved. In the context of machine learning, ensemble learning is particularly useful when dealing with unstable or high variance learning methods, such as decision trees. While a single decision tree may be fast, it may not provide optimal results. By training multiple decision trees, each with slightly different subsets of data, the variance can be reduced. During the classification or regression phase, the combined decisions of these trees are considered, typically through averaging for regression or voting for classification. This technique is known as the ensemble method. Bootstrap estimation Bootstrap estimation is a statistical technique used to estimate the variability and uncertainty associated with a particular statistic or parameter of interest. It is particularly useful when the underlying population distribution is unknown or when traditional statistical methods are difficult to apply. Bootstrap estimation has gained popularity due to its versatility and robustness. It can be applied to a wide range of statistical problems, including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, model selection, and more. AdaBoost AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a machine-learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It aims to combine multiple weak classifiers into a strong classifier. Bagging Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregation, is a technique that reduces the variance of statistical learning methods by using multiple classifiers trained on different subsets of the data. Instead of relying on a single classifier, bagging allows these classifiers to vote on the final decision. When using bagging, each classifier is trained on a randomly selected subset of the data, which is obtained through under-sampling. These classifiers are then combined by taking their aggregated decision, which helps improve the overall decision boundary. The variance of the mean of these independent estimates is reduced when compared to using just a single estimate. However, it's important to note that the reduction in variance is lower if the estimates are not independent. Random Forest Algorithm The random forest algorithm is an extension of the bagging decision tree approach. It involves creating a collection of decision trees from randomly selected subsets of the training dataset and combining their votes to determine the final class of test objects. In contrast to the decision tree algorithm, the random forest algorithm introduces randomness in the processes of finding the root node and splitting feature nodes. This randomness helps create independent trees within the forest. Out of bag error and feature importance The out-of-bag (OOB) error and feature importance are important aspects of the random forest algorithm. The OOB error provides an estimate of the model's performance, similar to validation or test data. In a random forest, each tree is trained on a bootstrapped sample, and on average, each tree uses about two-thirds of the training instances. The remaining one-third, referred to as the out-of-bag instances, can be used to estimate the response for each observation. By predicting the response using the trees where the observation was out-of-bag, multiple predictions can be obtained and then averaged. Feature importance of using Random forest (RF) Feature importance is a valuable aspect of using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. It allows us to assess the significance of each feature in the input dataset. The importance of a feature is determined based on how much it contributes to reducing impurity in the decision trees. Features that make a higher contribution to reducing impurity are considered more important. By utilizing feature importance in Random Forest, we can identify the most relevant features for classification and feature selection, which can ultimately enhance the model's performance.
