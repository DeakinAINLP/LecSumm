Topic 9 Learning Summary Report  Name: Viola Birech  Assignment: Task 9.1P  Institution: Deakin University  Date: 24/05/2023  1         Summary Report  Topic 9 Learning Summary  In topic 9 of our machine learning class, we covered a range of topics related to Nonlinear  models including boosting and random forests. Also resampling using bootstrap estimation with a  bootstrap sample which results in less variance and more accurate results. AdaBoost, which stands for  Adaptive Boosting, is a machine-learning algorithm for classification problems. It works by  combining weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. In contrast to using just one  classifier, bagging uses multiple classifiers trained on different under-sampled subsets and then allows  these classifiers to vote on a final decision. Bootstrap aggregation or bagging is a general-purpose  procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical learning methods.  Reflection  During topic 9 of my machine learning class, I studied various topics related to Nonlinear  models. I learned about how the bagging decision tree idea that defines a new method called a random  forest. The random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subsets of  the training dataset. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class  of the test objects.  The difference between the random forest algorithm and the decision tree algorithm is that in  the random forest algorithm, the processes of finding the root node and splitting the feature nodes will  run randomly. Random forest builds on the idea of bagging. Each tree is built from a bootstrap  sample of data. Node splits are calculated from random feature subsets to make sure each of the trees  is as independent as possible. Then we randomly pull out a subset and try work with the subset.  Whenever it needs to split to from the tree, based on the best feature, we choose the best feature from  the subset. Overall, I found the topic 9 topics very informative and relevant to the field of machine  learning. I look forward to applying these techniques in practical projects and experiments.  Summary of Reading List  The ninth section of the machine learning course incorporated a range of resources for  utilization which were all like the previous topicsâ€™ resources. I found these resources very helpful to  2   my understanding of the content studied. These readings consist of textbooks such as, Hands-On  Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow and Python Machine Learning  Other additional resources are the various code libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and  scikit-learn which can be heavily utilized to learn and practicalize the lessons learnt. Research papers  and articles from journals are also crucial resources to enhance investigation on current research areas  in the field of machine learning. Online platforms like Kaggle and Data Camp are also critical in  utilization as supplementary materials for practice exercises and tutorials.  Quiz Score  3
