If I talk about this topic learning, I learned a lot of concepts starting with ensemble learning which is technique that creates multiple models and then combines them to produce be(cid:425)er results than any single model. We also learned about Bootstrap Estimation which uses a method called resampling method which is found in statistics. Furthermore, we also learned about a method known as Bagging, which involves training the same algorithm multiple times and various types of subsets of the same dataset and then averaging the result.  In this topic we also learned about One of the important algorithm known as Random forest algorithem which is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multitude of decision trees at training time and outpu(cid:427)ng the class that is the mode of the classes or mean prediction of the individual trees.The random forest algorithm was also the part of this topic pass task coding activity where i used and demonstrated how we can apply the random forest algorithm on our dataset, it was great activity and learned a lot regarding adaboost and Random forest algorithm by doing it.  If I talk about ending of this topic was more revolved around practical implementation of the algorithm we learned, with learners being taught how to implement Random Forests and Boosting methods in Python which involves writing code, understanding various parameters, and interpreting the output. Such practical sessions help students get a hands-on understanding of these algorithms, preparing them well for real-world applications and also helped me to gain be(cid:425)er understanding of those algorithms.  To sum up, Topic 9 provides a good insight and comprehensive coverage of ensemble learning, from theoretical concepts to practical implementation. Through this topic's content, I got a clear understanding of various ensemble methods and their applications and how to apply these methods eﬀectively in our own machine-learning projects. I have also a(cid:425)ached this topic’s quiz results with this document.
