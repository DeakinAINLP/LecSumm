Ensemble Learning:  Topic â€“ 9  It the Machine learning technique which involves combining multiple machine learning models (base models) to improve the performance and accuracy for better predictability. It helps in reducing the variance and overfitting of model.  Bootstrap Estimation:  It makes use of statistical concept known as resampling, which is to create smaller samples of data from a larger dataset. Using Bootstrap method will improve the accuracy and result in lesser variance.  Bagging:  Bagging creates multiple subsets of training data through a process called bootstrapping, where the samples created are trained on separate base learner. Later the prediction based on base learner are combined through averaging or voting to make final predictions.  AdaBoost: (adaptive boosting)  It is popular machine learning algorithms to classify the data, basic methodology is used to commonly used with decision trees. This algorithm mainly focuses on training weak classifier to predict outputs that match outputs of stronger classifier.  Random Forest Classifier:  Random Forest Classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm, it makes use of bagging method. Random Forest Classifier method ensembles decision tree where each decision tree is trained on randomly sampled training data. Random Forest Classifier offers several advantages such Robustness, Reduces Overfitting, Important features and Scalability.
