Ensemble learning combines multiple models to solve problems, reducing variance of unstable methods like decision trees. Random Forest is a popular ensemble method with lower variance, using different data subsets for independent models.  Bootstrap sampling creates smaller samples from a larger one using resampling method, helping reduce variance and get more accurate results.  AdaBoost is a machine-learning algorithm for classification that combines weak classifiers to make a strong one, using steps like initializing weights, training weak classifiers, evaluating them, calculating classifier weight, and updating weights.  Bagging uses multiple classifiers trained on different subsets to vote on final decision, reducing variance of statistical learning methods and improving decision boundaries.  Random forest classifier uses decision trees from random subsets of training dataset and combines their votes for final class. It has two parameters: number of trees and number of features, and the error rate depends on tree correlation and strength.  Bagged model goodness estimated like other machine learning models; out-of-bag instances used for prediction. Random forest fast, parallelizable, handles data without pre-processing, and manages missing values.  Random Forest helps find important features in dataset for better model performance. Voting Classifier and Stack Classifier are ensemble learning techniques that combine predictions from different classifiers to improve accuracy and robustness.  Reflect on the knowledge that you have gained by reading contents of this topic with respect to machine learning.  This topic, I learned about ensemble learning in machine learning. It merges multiple models to solve problems and decrease variability, especially in decision trees. Random Forest, an ensemble method, uses varied data subsets for individual models. I also learned about bootstrap sampling, which makes smaller samples from a bigger dataset for better accuracy. AdaBoost is a classification algorithm that creates a strong classifier from weak ones through certain steps. Bagging uses several classifiers, each trained on different subsets, to vote on the final decision, reducing variance. The random forest classifier combines votes from decision trees from random subsets. The error rate in a random forest depends on the trees' correlation and strength. Lastly, I found that random forest can point out important features in a dataset for better model performance and Voting Classifier and Stack Classifier improve accuracy by combining predictions from different classifiers.
