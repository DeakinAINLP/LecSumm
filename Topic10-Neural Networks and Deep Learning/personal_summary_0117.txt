Following previous topic, the focus was to expand knowledge about supervised learning in depth with nonlinear supervised learning models including random forest.  Ensemble learning  Ensemble learning is a technique used to improve the accuracy and performance of machine learning models by combining multiple individual models. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with weak or inaccurate classifiers. By strategically generating and combining multiple models, such as decision trees, the ensemble method aims to reduce variance and enhance overall performance.  Ensemble models have a lower variance compared to individual models due to the principle of "wisdom of crowds" or "collective intelligence."  Bootstrap estimation  A resampling technique used in statistics to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic or to assess the uncertainty associated with a parameter estimate. It involves generating multiple bootstrap samples by randomly sampling observations from the original dataset with replacement.  Ada boost  It combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. The algorithm works by iteratively training weak classifiers on different subsets of the data, adjusting the weights of misclassified samples at each iteration.  Bagging  Aims to reduce the variance of a statistical learning method. It involves training multiple classifiers on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions to make a final decision.  Random forest algorithm  An extension of the bagging decision tree concept. It creates an ensemble of decision trees by building them from randomly selected subsets of the training dataset. The algorithm aggregates the predictions from different decision trees to make the final classification for test objects.  In contrast to the traditional decision tree algorithm, the random forest algorithm introduces randomness in the process of finding the root node and splitting the feature nodes. This randomness helps in creating diverse and independent decision trees within the random forest.  Random Forest is a powerful algorithm that can provide accurate predictions for both classification and regression problems. However, it has some limitations in terms of interpretability, overfitting, training time, and memory usage.  Random Forest assesses the significance of each feature based on its impact in reducing impurity in decision trees. This information can be used for feature selection and classification to improve model performance.  Out of bag error(OOB)    The OOB error estimation is a way to assess the performance of a bagged model, such as a random forest. In a random forest, each tree is trained on a bootstrapped sample, and the remaining instances that were not included in the sample are called OOB instances.
