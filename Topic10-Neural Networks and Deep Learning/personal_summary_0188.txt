 This topic I learnt about Ensemble learning, Bootstrap estimation, AdaBoost, Bagging, Random Forest algorithm, out of bag error, and feature importance using Random Forest. Let’s talk about all these above-mentioned topics brieﬂy.  Ensemble learning: This is type of machine learning technique that involves combining multiple models to obtain be(cid:425)er predictive performance than any individual model could achieve on its own. Ensemble learning can  improve the predictive  performance  by reducing overﬁtting,  increasing generalisation, and capturing diﬀerent aspects of the data.  To  reduce  the  variance  of  unstable  learning  methods  such  as  decision trees,  we  can  train  multiple decision trees, each have slightly diﬀerent subset of the data and then doing classiﬁcation/regression we take their combined decisions. This is called ensemble method and popular ensemble method is the Random Forest.  Bootstrap estimation: A bootstrap sample is smaller sample that is generated from larger sample. It uses a resampling method found in statistics.  AdaBoost:  AdaBoost  is  stand  for  Adaptive  Boosting  and  is  a  machine  learning  algorithm  for classiﬁcation problems. Its works by combining weak classiﬁers to create a strong classiﬁer.  Bagging: In bagging, multiple classiﬁers are trained independently on diﬀerent subsets of the training data. The ﬁnal prediction is typically obtained by averaging the predictions of all classiﬁers or taking a majority vote.  Random forest algorithm:  The random forest classiﬁer creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subsets of the training datasets. It then aggregates the votes from diﬀerent decision tress to decide the ﬁnal class of the test objects.  Out of bag error: This is the concept associated with ensemble learning methods, particularly with bagging  algorithms  like  random  forest.  In  bagging,  multiple  base  models  are  trained  on  diﬀerent subsets of the training data, created through bootstrap sampling. The OOB error provides an estimate of how well the ensemble model is likely to generalize to unseen data.  Feature importance of using Random Forest: The signiﬁcance of each feature in the input dataset can be determined using Random Forest and based on the average impurity reduction provided by each feature across all decision tress in the ensemble.  Answer to python:  Hyperparameter tuning is very important step in machine learning model development. It helps us to optimize  the  model  performance,  avoid  the  overﬁtting,  improve  the  eﬃciency.  By  tunning  the hyperparameter,  we  can  use  the  full  potential  of  machine  learning  models  and  can  achieve  be(cid:425)er results on wide range of tasks and datasets.
