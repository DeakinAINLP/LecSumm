TOPIC 9: NON-LINEAR MODELS (BOOSTING AND RANDOM FOREST)  Concept of ensemble learning, as it is the process by which  ● multiple models, such as classifiers or experts, are strategically generated and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem.  Bootstrap estimation, it is a resampling technique used to  ● estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. It is also a small sample that is generated from a small sample.  Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) is a machine-learning algorithm for  ● classification problems. It is a technique in machine technique as an ensemble method.  Understanding bagging as it is an ensemble learning method that  ● is commonly used to reduce variance within a noisy dataset. In bagging, a random sample of data in a training set is selected with replacement.  Random forest algorithm, it creates a set of decision trees from  ● randomly selected subsets of the training dataset. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is constructed from decision tree algorithms.  Learning out of bag error and feature importance, this approach  ● utilizes the usage of bootstrapping in random forest. It is a more convenient method since it does not need to divide the data into training and test.  ●  ●  ●  Understanding the feature importance of using random forest (RF)  Learning Random Forest in Python, running various codes.  Importing packages in python.  Boosting with Python that is one trying to reduce the bias of the  ● combined estimator.
