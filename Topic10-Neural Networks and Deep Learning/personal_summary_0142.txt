 In topic 8, we learned supervised learning further and using Python packages to create decision trees and random forest algorithms to solve real world problems.  Ensemble learning is the process by which multiple models, such as classifiers or experts, are strategically generated and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem.  Adaptive Boosting is a machine-learning algorithm for classification problems. It works by combining weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.  The random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subsets of the training dataset. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test objects. The difference between the random forest algorithm and the decision tree algorithm is that in the random forest algorithm, the processes of finding the root node and splitting the feature nodes will run randomly.
