This topic we learnt about non-linear supervised learning models like random forest. We used python packages to create decision trees and random forest algo to solve real world problems. Some of the topics that we covered this topic include but are not limited to Ensemble learning, Bootstrap Estimation, AdaBoost, Bagging, Random Forest Algo,Out of bag error and feature importance and Random Forest in Python. The non-linear supervised learning offers flexibility and the ability to capture intricate relationships in the data. They may be computationally expensive, require careful tuning of hyperparameters, and be prone to overfitting compared to linear models. That’s why it’s important to choose the appropriate non-linear model based on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand.
