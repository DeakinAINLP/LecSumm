Throughout this topic, I delved into the fascinating world of ensemble learning. I discovered that relying on a single classifier may not always yield accurate results, especially when dealing with complex datasets. Ensemble learning offers a solution by combining multiple models or experts to address computational intelligence problems effectively. One popular ensemble method I explored is Random Forest, which reduces variance by training a collection of decision trees using different subsets of data. These trees collectively make decisions through averaging or voting, resulting in more robust and accurate predictions.
