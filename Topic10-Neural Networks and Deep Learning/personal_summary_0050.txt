In this topic we cover Ensemble learning in machine learning that combine the insights obtained from multiple learning models to facilitate accurate and improved decisions  It combines multiple classifiers to increase the accuracy of classifiers. AdaBoost is an iterative ensemble method. AdaBoost classifier builds a strong classifier by combining multiple poorly performing classifiers so that you will get high accuracy strong classifier.  Bootstrap estimation which is done using data from only from the given sample.
