During this topic, I focused on ensemble machine learning algorithms, which  involve combining multiple models to improve performance. I learned about  popular ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.  Random Forest utilizes a voting mechanism among decision trees to make  predictions, reducing variance and increasing accuracy. On the other hand,  Gradient  Boosting  sequentially  adds  models  to  correct  errors  made  by  previous  models,  reducing  overfitting  and  improving  generalization.  I  also  discovered the importance of hyperparameter tuning in ensemble methods  and learned about techniques like grid search and cross-validation. Overall,  this  exploration  has  deepened  my  understanding  of  ensemble  algorithms  and their ability to enhance prediction tasks.
