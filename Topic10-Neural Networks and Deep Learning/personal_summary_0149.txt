Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines training from multiple models to improve predictive performance. We can combine multiple "weak" models, and the resulting "strong" model can make more accurate predictions.  The two mainly used ensemble learning techniques are:  Bagging: This involves training multiple models on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions.  Boosting: This involves training multiple models sequentially, with each subsequent model focusing on the examples that the previous model got wrong.  AdaBoost uses an iterative approach to learn from the mistakes of weak classifiers and turn them into strong ones. The algorithm assigns weights to each training example, with higher weights assigned to incorrectly classified instances. In each iteration, a new weak classifier is trained on the weighted data, and the weights are updated based on the classifier's performance. The final classifier is a weighted sum of the weak classifiers, with each classifier's weight determined by its performance.  In contrast to using just one classifier, bagging uses multiple classifiers trained on different under- sampled subsets and then allows these classifiers to vote on a final decision. Bootstrap aggregation or bagging is a procedure for reducing the variance of statistical learning methods.  Random Forest is a type of decision tree ensemble that combines multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and stable model. Random Forest is a powerful algorithm that can handle high- dimensional data with many features and can also handle missing data. It is also resistant to overfitting and can handle noisy data.
