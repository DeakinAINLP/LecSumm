 1.1  Ensemble learning Ensemble  learning  is  the  process  by  which  multiple  models,  such  as  classifiers  or  experts,  are strategically generated and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem.  1.2  Bootstrap estimation By using resampling methods, this results in reduced variance and more accurate results.  1.3  AdaBoost Adaptive  Boosting  is  a  machine-learning  algorithm  for  classification  problems.  It  works  by combining weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.  1.4  Bagging Use  multiple  classifiers  trained  on  different  under-sampled  subsets  and  then  allows  these classifiers to vote on a final decision.  1.5  Random forest algorithm The random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subsets of the training dataset. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test objects.  1.6  Out of bag error and feature importance Out of Bag is equivalent to validation or test data.  1.7  Feature importance of using Random Forest The importance of each feature is evaluated based on how helpful it is in reducing impurities in the decision  tree.  The  feature  importance  of  the  random  forest  improves  the  performance  of  the model and finds the most relevant features for classification and feature selection.  1.8  Voting Classifier Voting classifiers combine the predictions of various independent classifiers to provide the final prediction. Voting classifiers combine the strengths of various models while minimizing the impact of their specific flaws can improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions.  1.9  Stack Classifier Stacked classifiers that aggregate the predictions of various independent classifiers. The first layer includes  multiple  independent  classifiers  that  create  predictions  based  on  the  input  data.  The second layer integrates the predictions from the previous layer and may use several algorithms to arrive  at  the  final  prediction.  Stacked  classifiers  can  improve  the  accuracy  and  generality  of predictions  by  learning  more  complex  decision  boundaries  and  minimizing  the  chance  of           overfitting.  1.10 Random Forest in Python  2.1 Khan,  Muhammad  Almas,  et  al.
