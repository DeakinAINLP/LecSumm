This topics module covered the ensemble machine learning model, the Random Forest, which is a classification model which makes predictions by leverages a set of decision trees to aggregate votes that decide the class of a data-point. The Random Forest model feeds its set of decision trees data through a method called bagging (Bootstrap+aggregation) which samples the training data into subsets so each classifier tree is trained differently. These subsets of training data may also contain only a subset of training data features.
