Topic  Nine  started  with  Ensemble  learning,  moving  on  to  bootstrap  estimation  and  adaptive  boosting.  We  then expanded upon our knowledge of the Decision Trees and learnt about Bagging and the Random Forest Algorithm and how utilised several decision trees into to better predict an outcome. Once these concepts had been covered, we were shown how to apply these concepts in Python.
