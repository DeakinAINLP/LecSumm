Ensemble Learning  A machine learning technique called ensemble learning combines the predictions of various models (also referred to as base learners) to produce predictions that are more reliable and accurate. It makes use of the notion that a group of models, each trained on a different subset of data or with a different algorithm, can collectively outperform a single model.  The main concept behind ensemble learning is to spread out the base learners' learning styles so that they make different mistakes and make up for each other's weaknesses. Ensemble models can improve generalisation and prediction performance by reducing bias, variance, and overfitting by combining their predictions. (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019)  Bootstrap Estimation  By resampling the data, the statistical technique known as bootstrap estimation can be used to estimate the variability or uncertainty of a statistical parameter or model. When the underlying data distribution is unknown or challenging to model, it is especially helpful.  The main goal of bootstrap estimation is to simulate new datasets by taking replacement samples from the original data using random samples. We produce a set of bootstrap samples that are roughly the same size as the original dataset by repeatedly resampling the data. (Brownlee, 2018)  AdaBoost  The ensemble learning algorithm known as AdaBoost, or Adaptive Boosting, combines several weak learners to produce a strong learner. AdaBoost's main principle is to sequentially train a number of weak learners on various subsets of the training data. A decision stump (a decision tree with only one split), which performs only marginally better than random guessing, is an example of a weak learner. Each weak learner concentrates on the samples that the stronger learners misclassified, becoming accustomed to the challenging examples in the training data. (Saini, 2021)  Bagging  The main concept behind bagging is sampling with replacement, or "bootstrap sampling," that creates multiple subsets of the training data. Although every bootstrap sample is the same size as the initial training set, some samples might appear more than once while others might be excluded.  The Random Forest  The Random Forest algorithm combines several decision trees to produce predictions. The Random Forest algorithm offers several advantages:    Random Forest adds diversity to the decision trees by using various subsets of the training data and taking into account a random subset of features at each split. This diversity aids in lowering overfitting and enhancing the model's capacity for generalisation.    Because of how the final predictions are averaged or voted, Random Forest is resilient to  noisy data and outliers.    Due to the parallelization and tree-building process, Random Forest can handle large datasets  with high dimensionality effectively.  It's important to remember that Random Forest has some restrictions:    Interpretability: Compared to individual decision trees, Random Forest is harder to understand due to the ensemble nature of the model.    Memory and Processing: Random Forest uses multiple decision trees to store and process  predictions, which can be memory and processing-intensive for very large forests.  In general, the Random Forest algorithm is a powerful and popular ensemble learning technique that yields reliable and precise predictions. It has demonstrated success across numerous applications and domains and is appropriate for both classification and regression tasks. (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019b)  Voting Classifier  There are two main types of Voting Classifiers:    Hard Voting Classifier: A class label is predicted by each individual classifier in an ensemble  using a hard voting scheme, and the class label that receives the most votes is chosen as the final prediction. This strategy works well for classification issues where the class labels are distinct and incompatible.    Soft Voting Classifier: A soft voting scheme calculates the average probabilities across all classifiers for each class label after each individual classifier assigns a probability (or confidence) to each class label. The final prediction is the class label with the highest average probability. When the individual classifiers can provide probability estimates, as in logistic regression or support vector machines, this strategy is appropriate.  The Voting Classifier is capable of combining various classifier types, including decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, and any other classifier that can support the required probability estimation or prediction.  Stack Classifier  A meta-classifier is used to combine the predictions of various individual classifiers, also referred to as base models or learners, in the stack classifier, also known as stacking. In comparison to the Voting Classifier, it is a more sophisticated type of ensemble learning.  The training dataset for the Stack Classifier is split up into various subsets. The predictions from each base model are combined to create a new feature set after each model has been trained on a different subset of the data. The meta-classifier, which generates the final prediction, is trained using this new feature set as well as the initial input features. (Brownlee, 2020)
