This topic, I started to study nonlinear supervised learning. I learned the basic idea behind ensemble learning. I understood how bootstrap estimation works. I studied adaptive boosting and bootstrap aggregation, and how they work on classification problems. I learned the concept of a random forest classifier with its advantages and disadvantages and watched the video at the end of the learning resource page. I understood the concept of out of bag error. Additionally, I studied feature importance in the random forest model, voting classification, and stack classification. I inspected the Python implementation of random forest and boosting.
