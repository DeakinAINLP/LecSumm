 Starting from topic 9 we start to look at supervised learning instead of unsupervised learning. You will experiment with nonlinear supervised learning models, such as random forest in topic nine, and neural networks and deep learning in topic ten  By the end of topic 10 you will be able to:  ▪  analyse performance of ensemble classifiers with respect to a single model ▪  construct a multi-layer neural network using a backpropagation training algorithm to demonstrate data representation, classification and evaluation skills  Ensemble learning  Ensemble learning is a technique in machine learning that combines multiple models to improve the accuracy and generalization of the final model.  By using ensemble learning, We can help reduce the impact of overfitting and improve the robustness of their models. Techniques such as bootstrap estimation, AdaBoost  and bagging can be used to improve the performance of ensemble classifiers    Bootstrap estimation  Bootstrap estimation is a statistical technique used to estimate the accuracy of a model by resampling the data.  It involves randomly selecting subsets of the data and training the model on each subset to obtain a distribution of the model's accuracy. Bootstrap estimation can be used to estimate the confidence interval and standard error of the model's accuracy.  AdaBoost  AdaBoost is an ensemble learning technique used to improve the accuracy of a model by combining weak classifiers.  It works by assigning weights to each weak classifier to create a strong classifier that can accurately predict outcomes. AdaBoost can be used for binary classification and multi-class classification problems     Bagging  Bagging is an ensemble learning technique used to improve the accuracy of a model by creating multiple subsets of the data and training multiple models on each subset.  We can see here the difference between bagging and boosting  The models are then combined to create a final model with improved accuracy. Bagging can be used with various models such as decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines  Random Forest Algorithm  The random forest algorithm is an ensemble learning technique that uses decision trees to classify data.    It works by creating multiple decision trees on different subsets of the data and combining them to create a more accurate model. The random forest algorithm can be used for classification and regression problems  Out of bag error and feature importance  Out of bag error is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a random forest model by measuring the accuracy of the model on data that was not included in the training process.  It can be used to estimate the accuracy of the model on new data. Feature importance measures the relative importance of each feature in a model, providing insights into which features are most influential in predicting the outcome. Feature importance can be used to identify the most important features and eliminate irrelevant features, which can improve model accuracy and reduce overfitting  Feature of importance of using random forest  The feature importance of using random forest can help to identify the most influential features in a dataset, enabling better feature selection and improved model accuracy.  Feature importance can be used to eliminate irrelevant features, reduce overfitting, and improve model performance.  By analysing the feature importance of a random forest model, we can gain insights into which features are most relevant to the problem they are trying to solve  Voting classifier  A voting classifier is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple models by taking a vote on the predicted outcome of each model. The model with the most votes is selected as the final prediction. The voting classifier can be used with different models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees  Stack Classifier     A stack classifier is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple models by training a meta-model on the predictions of multiple base models. The meta-model uses the predictions of the base models to make a final prediction, improving the overall accuracy of the model. The stack classifier can be used with various models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks  Random Forest in Python  Random forest is a popular ensemble learning technique that can be implemented in Python using libraries such as scikit-learn. Scikit-learn provides a user-friendly and efficient way to build and evaluate random forest models. We can learn how to implement and optimize random forest models using Python, experiment with different hyperparameters, and evaluate the model's accuracy.  Boosting with Python  Boosting is another ensemble learning technique that can be implemented in Python using libraries such as XGBoost. XGBoost provides a way to improve the accuracy of machine learning models by combining multiple weak learners. We can learn how to implement and optimize boosting models using Python, experiment with different hyperparameters, and evaluate the model's accuracy. Boosting can be used with various models such as decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks
