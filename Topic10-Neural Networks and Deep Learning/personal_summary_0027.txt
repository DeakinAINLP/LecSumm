A  common  machine  learning  algorithm  that  falls  under  the  umbrella  of  ensemble methods is Random Forest. It is renowned for its potency and adaptability and is utilised for both classification and regression applications.  The  primary  principle  of  Random  Forest  is  to  integrate  the  forecasts  of  different decision  trees  to  get  predictions  that  are  more  reliable  and  accurate.  Random  Forest builds an ensemble of decision trees instead of depending on a single tree, with each tree trained on a different portion of the training data.  Ensemble Learning: Random  Forest is a member of the ensemble learning family of algorithms. The goal of ensemble learning is to increase performance and generalisation by  combining  numerous  separate  models  to  produce  predictions.  In  the  instance  of Random Forest, an ensemble of different decision trees is created.  Bootstrap  Estimation:  The  bootstrap  estimation  method  is  used  by  Random  Forest. Multiple random samples are created via replacement from the original training data as part  of  the  bootstrap  estimation  process.  In  the  Random  Forest,  these  samples  are utilised to train various decision trees. The bootstrap sampling brings variance into the training process and aids in producing varied subsets of data.  Bagging:  As  the  ensemble  approach,  Random  Forest  uses  bagging  (bootstrap aggregation). Bagging is the process of individually training various models on various bootstrap  samples,  then  combining  the  results  of  those  models'  predictions.  Each decision tree in the Random Forest is autonomous and diversified since it was trained using a separate bootstrap sample.  RF  Algorithm:  The  above-mentioned  ideas  are  combined  by  the  Random  Forest algorithm to produce an ensemble of decision trees. The predictions from each tree are aggregated by voting (for  classification) or averaging (for regression) after  each  tree has been trained on a sample of the data and features. This ensemble strategy enhances generalisation, decreases overfitting, and improves model performance.  For better prediction accuracy and robustness, the Random Forest ensemble learning technique builds an ensemble of decision trees using bootstrap estimation and bagging.
