I confirm that I have successfully learnt the below-mentioned topics.  1.  Ensemble learning 2.  Bootstrap estimation 3.  AdaBoost 4.  Bagging 5.  Random forest algorithm 6.  Out-of-bag error and feature importance 7.  Advanced topics (feature importance of using random forest)  I had no prior knowledge of these concepts, so discovering them was really interesting and exciting, as it introduced me to a new facet of machine learning. Additionally, working with Python for the practical implementation of these concepts was a fresh experience for me. After studying the theory, watching the provided videos and lecture, and exploring additional online resources, I was able to comprehend the theories effectively.
