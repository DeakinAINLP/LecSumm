This topic we covered the concept of ensemble learning, focusing on Random Forest algorithm and Adaboost.  Ensemble learning – A machine learning concept in which multiple models are trained to solve the same problem and combined to get better results. The main hypothesis behind ensemble methods is that when weak models are correctly combined, we can obtain more accurate and/or robust models.  Bagging – A form of ensemble learning. It involves training each model on a different random subset of the original data, then aggregating their predictions.  Boosting – A form of ensemble learning. This approach trains each new model to correct the errors made by the previous ones. Then, all models vote to make the final prediction, but models that are better at predicting are given more weight.  Random Forest – An ensemble learning algorithm. It creates a collection of decision trees that have each been trained on random subsets of the data and features.  Bootstrap sampling– Used to estimate various properties about a dataset by taking many samples from the same dataset. In Random Forest, each decision tree is trained on a different dataset. These datasets are created using bootstrap sampling from the original data.  AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) – An ensemble learning method, where a set of weaker models combine to form a strong predictive model. The strength of AdaBoost lies in its ability to constantly learn from the mistakes of the weak learners.
