 The topic for this topic is Non-Linear Model (Boosting and Random Forest)  Ensemble method: It is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model.  Bootstrap sample: A bootstrap sample is a smaller sample that is generated (bootstrapped) from a larger sample. It uses a resampling method found in statistics.  AdaBoost: It is a machine-learning algorithm for classiﬁcation problems. It works by combining weak classiﬁers to create a strong classiﬁer.  Bagging: It is a general-purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical learning methods.    Random Forest is built on the idea od Bagging. Each tree is built from a bootstrap sample of  data. In a Random Forest:    o  All trees are fully grown with no pruning. o  There are two parameters:  1.  Number of trees (T) 2.  Number of features  Advantages and Disadvantages of Random Forest:    Random forest is fast to build and even faster to predict.   Ability to handle data without pre-processing.   Automatic handling of missing values.
