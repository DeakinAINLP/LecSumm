   Ensemble Learning:    Refers to the method of combining multiple individual models to create a more  powerful and accurate model.    Helps to improve generalizability and robustness of the model.    Common techniques include bagging, boosting, and stacking.    Bootstrap Estimation:    A statistical method that involves sampling data points with replacement.    Used to estimate the sampling distribution of an estimator by resampling from the  original dataset.    Helps to quantify the uncertainty of the estimator.         AdaBoost:    Stands for Adaptive Boosting, a type of ensemble learning method.    Works by combining multiple weak learners to create a strong learner.    In each iteration, it focuses more on the instances that were misclassified in the previous iteration.    Bagging:      Stands for Bootstrap Aggregating, a type of ensemble learning method.  Involves creating multiple subsets of the original data, training a model on each, and combining their predictions.    Helps to reduce variance and prevent overfitting.           Random Forest Algorithm:    An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees.    Each tree is trained on a different subset of the data and makes its own predictions.    The final prediction is made by taking a vote from all the trees.    Advantages/Disadvantages of Random Forest:    Advantages: High accuracy, handles missing values, can be used for both  classification and regression.    Disadvantages: Can be slow to train if the dataset is very large, not easily  interpretable.    Feature Importance of Using Random Forest:    Random Forest provides a measure of how important each feature is in making  predictions.    Calculated based on the decrease in impurity when splitting on a feature.    Helps in understanding which features contribute most to the model's predictions.    Examples of Using Random Forest in the real world:    Predicting house prices: Random Forest can consider various features of a house and  its surroundings to predict its price.    Disease diagnosis: Random Forest can be used to diagnose diseases based on a  patient's medical records.
