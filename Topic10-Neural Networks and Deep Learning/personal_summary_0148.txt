  Summary:  o  Random Forest:  ▪  Ensemble  Learning:  Random  Forest  is  an  ensemble  learning  machine learning  technique  that  integrates  predictions  from  several  models  to improve accuracy. During training, it entails building many decision trees, each  using  a  randomly  selected  subset  of  data  (bootstrapping)  and evaluating  just  a  subset  of  characteristics  at  each  node  (random subspaces). Without trimming, each tree is allowed to develop to its full potential. In order to reduce biases and overfitting, it averages the output of all trees for regression problems and picks the most common class for classification  issues.  Random  forests,  despite  their  robustness  and versatility, can be computationally costly and less successful with sparse data.  ▪  Bootstrap Estimation: Random Forest is a bootstrap estimation  ensemble learning approach. It bootstraps the original dataset into numerous subgroups and builds a decision tree for each subset. For splitting, each tree evaluates a random subset of characteristics at each node. After all trees have been built, their predictions are integrated, either by average in regression tasks or by selecting the most common class in classification tasks. This bootstrapping decreases model variance, prevents overfitting, and provides a way to estimate model fidelity. However, because several trees are required, it can increase computing complexity.  ▪  Bagging:  Bagging,  also  known  as  bootstrap  aggregation,  is  a  key component of the Random Forest method. It entails splitting the original data into numerous parts (bootstrapping), generating a decision tree for each  subset,  and  then  aggregating  the  predictions.  Only  a  fraction  of characteristics  are  examined  at  each  node  in  each  tree,  increasing  the model's  variety  and  unpredictability.  Aggregation  decreases  model variance  and  hence  prevents  overfitting.  The  capacity  to  form  trees independently enables parallel processing, which speeds up the process. Furthermore, because each tree excludes around one-third of the cases during  bootstrapping,  bagging  provides  an  out-of-bag  (OOB)  error estimate  approach.  However,  when  a  large  number  of  trees  are employed, bagging might increase computational burden.  ▪  RF  algorithm:  Random  Forest  (RF)  is  a  classification  and  regression ensemble  learning  technique.  It  use  bootstrap  sampling  to  generate several  subsets of  the original  data.  On  each  sample,  a  decision  tree  is constructed using just a random subset of characteristics at each split. The predictions of the trees are then pooled; for classification, the majority vote is used, but for regression, an average is computed. The RF method is  resistant  to  outliers  and  nonlinear  data,  can  handle  imbalanced datasets, and generates feature significance ratings. However, with a big   number  of  trees,  it  can  be  computationally  costly.  Despite  this,  RF  is  a popular machine learning technique due to its simplicity, versatility, and great performance.    Reading list: Lecture Slides, Lecture Recordings, Learning Contents.   My  reflections:  Random  Forest  (RF)  is  a  machine  learning  ensemble  approach  for classification  and  regression applications.  During  training,  several  decision  trees  are created, each using a bootstrapped subset of data and taking into account a random subset of characteristics at each node (random subspaces). It averages the outputs of regression tasks and selects the most common class for classification tasks to provide final predictions. Bootstrapping and bagging are critical components of RF, since they increase model variety  while  decreasing  overfitting.  Bootstrapping  entails  dividing  the  original  data into  subgroups  and  developing  a  decision  tree  for  each.  Bagging,  also  known  as bootstrap  aggregation,  reduces  overfitting  by  combining  predictions  from  separate trees.  Bagging  also  enables  for  parallel  processing  and  error  estimates  out-of-bag (OOB). RF can be computationally costly, especially with a large number of trees, despite its resilience,  adaptability,  and  capacity  to  handle  skewed  data  and  outliers.  It  may potentially underperform when dealing with sparse data. Nonetheless, RF is a popular machine learning approach due to its simplicity, versatility, and good performance.
