 The main topic this topic was various ensemble learning strategies, which integrate numerous  models to enhance predictive performance. The Random Forest is a well-known ensemble  method that builds numerous decision trees and aggregates their forecasts to produce a ﬁnal  prediction. Random Forests are renowned for their dependability and capacity for handling large  amounts of data.  Another algorithm for ensemble learning is called AdaBoost, which stands for Adaptive  Boosting. It operates by repeatedly training weak classiﬁers on various subsets of the training  data and giving instances that were incorrectly categorized a higher weight.  Multiple classiﬁers are trained using distinct randomly picked subsets of the training data in a  process known as bagging, also known as bootstrap aggregation.  Each classiﬁer is trained independently, and the ﬁnal prediction is created by combining all of  the classiﬁers' predictions, frequently by voting. Bagging enhances model generalization and  lowers overﬁtting.  We discussed the bagging metric known as out-of-bag error as our ﬁnal point. On instances that  weren't part of the training subset, it calculates each tree's prediction error. Without a separate  validation set, out-of-bag error offers an estimation of the model's performance.
