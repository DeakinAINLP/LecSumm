In  this  topic  has  explore  the random  forest.  It  is fast  to  build  and  fast  to  predict.  Random forest has the ability to handle data without pre-processing. We also go through ensemble learning,  and  thereâ€™s  an  ensemble  learning  technique  called  voting  classifier  and  stack classifier. The voting classifier combines the predictions of various separate classifiers to provide a final prediction. For stack classifier, is much more complex than the vote classifier.  Stack classifier is  stacking  the  output  of  individual  estimator  and  using  a  classifier  to  compute  the  final prediction.
