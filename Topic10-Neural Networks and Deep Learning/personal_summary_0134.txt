Summaryï¼š This topic's main content is integrating ML algorithms. Including Bootstrap, Bagging & Random Forest, Python practice  Bootstrap  Bootstrap can reduce variance and get more accurate results. Adaptive Boosting can be used to work by combining weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. Bootstrap is a resampling technique.  Bagging & Random Forest  Bagging uses multiple classifiers trained on different under sampled subsets. Based on the idea of Bagging, random forests can be extended. The processes of finding the root node and splitting the feature nodes both run randomly.  Python practice  Try Adaptive Boosting and Random  Forest  in Python. Try  using  Gradient  Boost. Try  using  Stack Classifier or Voting Classifier for composite algorithms.
