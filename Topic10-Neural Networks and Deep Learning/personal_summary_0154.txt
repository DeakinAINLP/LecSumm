 This main topic of topic was about ensemble learning, which involves combining multiple models or classifiers to solve a computational intelligence problem. random forest, bagging, adaboost, Bootstrap Sampling and some other advanced topics like Voting Classifier and stack classifier. In other words, to increase model accuracy, decrease overfitting, and handle complicated datasets, ensemble learning approaches including Random Forest, AdaBoost, and the usage of bagging and bootstrap sampling are available.
