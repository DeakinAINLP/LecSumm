Ensemble learning is used to strategically generate and combine multiple models like classifiers or experts to solve a specific computational problem. It is a powerful technique that uses the combination of multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and reduce variance. It is particularly useful when dealing with weak or unstable models, such as decision trees, and requires thoughtful design and training strategies to ensure the ensemble performs well.  Bootstrap estimation is a resampling technique which can be used to estimate the sampling distribution of data. The process creates multiple resamples called bootstrap samples, each having the same size as the original dataset, by randomly sampling with replacement from the original dataset. These allow us to make inferences and assess the variability as well as the uncertainty associated with the original estimate.  Adaptive Boosting is an ensemble machine learning algorithm designed for classification problems. The algorithm focuses on combining weak classifiers to create a much stronger classifier. Each topic classifier is trained with a subset of training data. The final classifier combines the predictions of all the weak classifiers into one and boosts the overall performance of the ensemble.  Bagging is another ensemble technique used for the general purpose of reducing variance of statistical learning methods. Instead of using only one classifier, bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, trains multiple classifiers independently on different bootstrap samples and then allows for the final prediction to be voted on.  Random forest is another ensemble learning technique, it uses the principles of the bagging aggregation technique and combines it with decision tree classifiers.  It creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subsets of training data and then combines the votes to decide the final class of the test object. We can also use this technique to determine the significance of each feature is the dataset by seeing how much the feature helps in reducing the impurity of the dataset.
