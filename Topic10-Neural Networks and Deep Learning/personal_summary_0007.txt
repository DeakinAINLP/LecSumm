This topic, I learned about the realm of decision trees and ensemble learning. Decision trees intrigued me as graphical representations that map possible outcomes from a series of related options or decisions. They enable decision-making based on specific criteria or conditions by providing a clear understanding of paths and their associated probabilities or values. Ensemble learning captivated my attention as it leverages the collective knowledge of diverse and independent decision makers. To implement decision trees and ensemble learning models, I focused on utilizing the 'sklearn' library in Python. 'sklearn' offered powerful tools, enabling the creation of decision trees, training of random forest models, and evaluation of their performance. Speaking of random forests, I discovered they are ensemble learning methods that utilize collections of decision trees. By incorporating bootstrap estimation, which involves creating subsets of the dataset through random sampling, random forests achieve improved accuracy and generalization by aggregating individual tree predictions. Additionally, I explored boosting algorithms like Adaboost and bagging techniques. Adaboost iteratively trains weak learners to build a strong learner, assigning higher weights to misclassified instances. Bagging involves generating multiple subsets of the dataset through bootstrap sampling and training individual models. Finally, I was thrilled to implement boosting algorithms and random forests in Python, utilizing libraries such as 'sklearn,' 'xgboost,' or 'lightgbm.' These resources empower me to leverage the advantages of boosting and random forest models in my future projects.
