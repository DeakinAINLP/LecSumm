 This topic mainly talks about Ensemble learning. It introduces the concept of ensemble learning. Then it introduces a sampling method. An ensemble classification algorithm called AdaBoost is illustrated afterwards. After that, it demonstrates the mechanism of Bagging, which uses multiple classifiers. Random forest algorithm whose idea is based on mentioned Bagging is also elaborated in this chapter. Then it lists pros and cons of Random Forest. It also talk about the effects of Random Forest on feature selection. Additionally, Voting and Stack Classifier are also mentioned. At last, it demonstrates the python implementation of Random Forest, Boosting. In this study, the internal mechanism of Random Forest impressed me. Besides, some machine learning books also helped me a lot.
