In the first topic of the SIT 720 Machine Learning class they initiated with the basic programming knowledge about the python. They introduced with essential tools for the machine learning and they went through algorithms.  They mentioned about the what is  machine learning that is ability for the computer to learn without programmed. Further also mentioned about why do we need machine learning and its real world application of machine learning like nowadays its applicable in all the sector like computer vision , board games like where you play against the robot, its also useful in voice recognition. Its now implemented in healthcare sector for the better understanding of the patient, and so on. There were several YouTube videos for better understanding of the concepts.  They introduced us to the  steps involved in machine learning that is data manipulation , analytics and evaluation and visualization. They also mentioned about the different types of machine learning methods like Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement Learning they mentioned in depth about all these methods. They even thought us about the model selection because in machine learning the difficult task is to select the best model for application.       They introduced us mathematics for machine learning , the implementation of mathematics in machine learning that included the Vectors and basic vector operations, Matrices and matrix operations , matrix algebra and Basic concept of probability.  Later setting up the python environment. How to use the python environment . Its also included the basic of python like what are the types of variables and how to declare a function and utilizing the modules and packages like numpy and so on we also had In-hand experience in using all the functionality.
