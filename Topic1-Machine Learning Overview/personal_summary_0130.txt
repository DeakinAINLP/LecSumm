The main points of this topic revolve around the basics of machine learning. It goes through some of the general concepts around supervised vs unsupervised machine learning, and also through some of the basic mathematical concepts that govern machine learning such as the Euclidean distance and cosine similarity between data points represented as a vector. It also goes through some of the basic python concepts that would be needed to code machine learning algorithms in the upcoming topics, as well as some further mathematical concepts with matrices like matrix operations.
