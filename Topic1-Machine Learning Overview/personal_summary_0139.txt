In the first topic, I learned some basic concepts of machine learning  and basic usage of Python. Among them, machine learning is "Field of  study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly  programmed,"  and  in  reality,  there  are  many  applications  such  as  robots, board games, and voice identification.  It is generally divided into 3 steps, the first step is to collect/manipulate  the data, the second step is to analyze the data, and the third step is  to evaluate the existing data and visualize it.  Among  them,  supervised  learning  is  more  important.  Specifically,  it  includes Supervised learning is trained, Training and evaluation data,  and A mathematical definition. It has Two types of supervised learning,  one of which is linear and the other is nonlinear.  The other is unsupervised learning, the most important performance  of which is Clustering. For example, in movie scoring, you can predict  what kind of score they will give to other movies by assuming each  user's preferences and combining their past ratings for movies.  The  last  is  reinforcement  learning.  Its  main  concept  is  to  constantly  find  the  optimal  solution  to  this  problem  in  each  iteration  by interacting  with  the  environment.  For  example,  in  the  cold  winter,  I  found a fire, too close, it may burn me, too far away, then I can't feel  its  warmth.  I'll  keep  interacting  with  this  fire  until  I  find  a  distance  where I can feel the warmth without being too hot.  The most important part of this topic, I think, is the Python part. One  is, what variables does Python have, the other is how to make logical  judgments, the third is loop iterations, the fourth is functions, and the  fifth is Python modules and packages, the most important of which is  the NumPy package. The sixth is matrix and its operation.
