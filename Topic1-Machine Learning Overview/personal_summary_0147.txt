The topic of machine learning makes considerable use of a wide variety of subfields within mathematics.  In machine learning, linear algebra is used in a variety of ways, some of which include the multiplication of matrices, the vector calculus, and the calculation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. These are just a few examples.  Calculus is a key tool in the field of machine learning (ML), which use it to tackle optimisation issues like reducing cost functions and increasing probability functions.  Probability theory is essential to the process of machine learning since it allows for the completion of a number of tasks, such as the creation of probabilistic models and the drawing of statistical conclusions.  Statistical analysis is used in a wide variety of elements of machine learning, including the testing of hypotheses, the analysis of regression, and the validation of models.  The field of machine learning makes extensive use of graph theory, with only two examples being recommendation systems and the analysis of social network data.  The field of information theory is used in machine learning to complete tasks such as feature selection and model compression.  In the field of machine learning, numerical analysis is used for a variety of tasks, including the resolution of optimisation issues and the approximation of function values.  These subfields of mathematics serve as the conceptual underpinnings for a variety of the machine learning algorithms and procedures that are now in use. Building and implementing efficient machine learning models requires a comprehensive grasp of the aforementioned mathematical topics.
