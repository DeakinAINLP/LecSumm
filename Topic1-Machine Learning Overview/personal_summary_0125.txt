 Differentiate supervised learning and unsupervised learning  Supervised learning is the learning of the model which has the input as known and labelled data. We can divide the dataset into different groups to training and testing dataset and repeat for different random splits to choose the best model.  Conversely, unsupervised learning provides the dataset without additional information. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find relative similarities in the data points. From the similarities, we can find insight into the dataset. Two ways to approach unsupervised learning are clustering and factor analysis.  Python  Data types: strings, integers, and tuples are immutable while lists, dictionaries are mutable.  To multiply the two matrices, the columns in the first matrix must be equal to the rows of the second matrix. (Syntax: A.dot(C))  Function: To define a function, you can use ‘def’ at the beginning of the function, or use ‘lambda’ to have an anonymous function.
