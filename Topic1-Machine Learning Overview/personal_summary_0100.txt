● Machine Learning = improved algorithm performance via experience (training). ● Machine Learning has many applications including: gaming, voice recognition, robotics, handwriting recognition (OCR), image recognition (medical diagnoses, face recognition, retina recognition), and writing computer software (OpenAI ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot).  ● Steps: Data Manipulation => Analytics => Evaluation and Visualisation ● Supervised learning = model to map inputs to known outputs ● Training is possible due to known relationships in the data ● Classification problems = determining which group/bucket data falls into ● Regression problems = predicting a value from a set of input data ● Unsupervised learning = finding patterns and relationships in unlabelled data ● Clustering = grouping similar data points together ● Unsupervised learning is useful for information retrieval, data compression (reduction),  anomaly detection, data understanding and visualization  ● Reinforcement learning = learning from the outcomes of actions (success vs failure) ● Over-fitting = training a model to match the training data set too closely ● Vector space model = a set of documents represented as vectors
