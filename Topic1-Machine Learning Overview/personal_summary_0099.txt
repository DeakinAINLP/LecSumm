I.  What is Machine Learning?  Summary  -  ML is a set of tools to derive meaning from data. ML exists to handle a huge amount data and makes sense out of those data to achieve useful results.  -  ML is a brand of AI which focuses on data and algorithms to  imitate the way that humans learn and improves its accuracy by each iteration.  II.  Real-world applications of ML: -  Robotics: Robots are created to do certain tasks such as cleaning, cooking, vacuuming but thanks to ML, they can predict the book that we like, play the right song to suit the right mood. Humanoid robots now learn walking and jumping patterns. SLAM is also created to find the routes for rescue robots.  -  Computer Vision: Thanks to ML, computer now can detect objects via an advanced capture device(A-eye). Some of the characteristics can be pointed out such as colour, type of car, the height of a person, the behaviour of a human face, etc and this all based on how we apply ML.  -  Board Games: AlphaGo is one of the best examples of this field.  This board-game-playing AI from Google’s DeepMind is built based on the concept of Reinforcement Learning and uses the neural networks applying Monte Carlo tree search to find the best move. This introduces of Q-Learning.  -  Voice Recognition: To differentiate people voice, ML have  experienced waves as data to enhance speech recognition. One person’s voice is compared with more than “140 unique physical and behavioural characteristics”. Siri and Google Home (Alexa) are two examples of this real-world application.  -  Digit Recognition: Machines can read handwritten numbers and letters and the output is the machine-encoded equivalent (99% accuracy).         III.  Machine Learning steps: ML goes through many steps for the  computers to evaluate the problem and then make the decisions. Below are the stages to operate:  - Step 1: Data Manipulation is simply a process of data preparation, and the object is usually the largest datasets. These datasets will go through a process called data acquisition which samples information that illustrates real world physical conditions with a predefined measurement. Then, once we stored the data in databases, Data cleaning must be conducted to get rid of any redundant, noisy, unusable data.  - Step 2: Analytics is mainly about finding the relationships and correlations to design an accurate model from the prepared input datasets. Exploratory Data Analysis summarise the main characteristics or features of datasets using concepts such as graphs, charts, and tables. Then, moving the datasets to Predictive Machine Learning, this stage apply a variety of statistical techniques to build classifier or system for decision making.  - Step 3: Evaluation and Visualisation is the intake of the system or model which is the result of the previous step. And in this step, we must evaluate the performance of the system by using Refinement procedure.  IV.  Supervised learning: large part of ML uses supervised learning which is defined as learning a function (model) from data to relate inputs to known outputs. In SL, the datasets have built-in relationships which enable algorithm training so that machine can learn. Training requires dividing the available data into training data and evaluation data. After developing a function ‘model’, we should know the relationship between inputs and outputs. Supervised learning is also described mathematically:  SL has 2 types:       - Classification problems: we separate the data points by boundaries which are linear or non-linear. - Regression problems: this is based on the idea of regression to determine the relationship between response variables and one or more predictor variables.  V.  Unsupervised learning: is to determine the underlying structure of a dataset which is unlabelled. It uses the concept of clustering which is the process of grouping similar points together in order to find relative similarities and correlations in data points.  VI.  Reinforcement learning:  The learner (a machine or a human) acts on its environment, receives some evaluation based on its action (reward), but is not told which action is the correct one for a desired end goal. The learner’s actions affect the data it receives later.
