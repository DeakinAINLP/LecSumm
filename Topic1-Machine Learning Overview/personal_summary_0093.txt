For topic1, we learn about the concepts of Machine Learning(ML), supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. We also know about the relationship between mathematics and machine learning.  Regarding to python learning in this topic, we know about some basic codes like print, variables, lists and so on. In my view, the most important are loops, functions, packages and operations between matrices.
