Summarise the main points that is covered in this topic Topic 1 introduced what is Machine Learning before discussing some real-world applica;ons of machine learning such as Robo;cs, Computer Vision, Board games etc. We then learnt the steps in ML which included the following –  1.  Data Collec;on 2.  Cleaning and prepara;on of data 3.  Training of Build model 4.  Evalua;on of model 5.  Deploy and improvement  Then we learnt about the diﬀerent types of Machine Learning models such as –  1.  Supervised Learning 2.  Unsupervised Learning 3.  Reinforcement Learning  In supervised learning, we work with labelled data whereas in unsupervised learning, we work with unlabelled data. Reinforcement learning deals with real-;me ac;vi;es such as robot naviga;on.  We learnt the diﬀerent types of Supervised Machine Learning models which are –  1.  Classiﬁca;on problems 2.  Regression problems  We learnt about diﬀerent types of Unsupervised Machine Learning models which are –  1.  Clustering 2.  Dimensionality reduc;on  We then learnt how to split the input data into training and test datasets to train a model, how to evaluate a model and how to avoid over-ﬁQng of a model.  Then we focused on the mathema;cs behind Machine Learning, speciﬁcally how vectors, matrices and probability play an important role in Machine Learning.  We learnt about diﬀerent vector opera;ons such as transpose, addi;on, inner product, magnitude of a vector and cosine similarity between vectors. Next, we learnt about the diﬀerent opera;ons on matrix such as addi;on, subtrac;on, scalar mul;plica;on, scalar division, and the type of matrices such as rectangular matrix, square matrix, symmetric matrix, diagonal matrix, iden;fy matrix, inverse of a matrix and orthogonal matrix.  Next, we set up our Python environment using Anaconda and Jupyter notebook. We then learnt about how to program in Python and how to use packages.
