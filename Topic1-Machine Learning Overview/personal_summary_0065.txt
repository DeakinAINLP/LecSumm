Topic 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning  Welcome to Machine Learning Goals    Applications in solving real-world problems.   Design decisions when creating AI.   Quality of machine learning-based solution   Development and performance of the tool  Essential Skills and Concepts Algorithms    A set of instructions that solves a problem.  Define Machine Learning Machine Learning    Computers can learn without being directly programmed   Computer should learn only when performance improves through experience  o  Experience is the information the machine processes using Tasks o  To get closer to what you want to produce, the performance measure P o  However, if the machine continues to perform tasks at an unsatisfactory level; it has not  learned    Machine Learning in my own words: The ability of a computer/machine to develop a human-like decision-making mindset to solve and produce an efficient solution for a copious amount of data.  Real-World Applications of Machine Learning Robotics    Cleaning, walking and jumping patterns by robots   E.g Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) uses data to find routes for rescue robots.  Boar-games    AlphaGo, a board game-playing AI that uses deep neural networks and Monte Carlo Tree search  Voice Recognition    Alexa and Siri.   Natural Language processing  Digit Recognition    Reading the images of handwritten numbers and letters and outputting their machine-encoded  equivalent. Detecting number plates    Other applications include stock market predictions, business analytics, facial recognition  Real-World Applications of Machine Learning Diagram  Learning Steps    Manipulation  o  1st step of data preparation o  Data Acquisition (Step 1)  ▪  Sampling information that signifies real-world physical conditions (predefined measurements)  ▪  E.g for a car, you might need to measure the engine size, number of doors, size of  tires  ▪  Data should be reliable during the conversion to digital numeric values that can be determined by the computer; the number of doors on a car is easy to identify, but the style of the door is harder to assign numerically  o  Data Cleaning (Step 3)  ▪  Once data is stored; noisy or unusable parts of it should be trimmed ▪  E.g data entries where in some cases there might be entries where cars are signified as “3 wheeled”, should be removed considering they do not exist  ▪  This could affect the ML algorithm    Analytics  o  2nd step in ML o  Finding correlations win prepared data  ▪  designing an accurate model based on input data  o  Exploratory Data Analysis  ▪  Analyse datasets to summarise their main characteristics or features. ▪  Things like graphs and charts make data easier to understand.  o  Predictive Machine Learning  ▪  Predicative modelling to build a classifier or intelligent system for decision-    Evaluation and Visualisation  making.  o  Evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the predictive model o If the outcome is unsatisfactory, the Refinement procedure ▪  Another round of data manipulation/analytics  Supervised Learning Supervised learning is trained    Learning function (model) from data to relate inputs to known outputs   Datasets have relationships inbuilt  o  E.g if datasets comprise cars that have 4 wheels and bikes with 2 wheels; o  Having 2 wheels is a function of having a bike o  Having 4 wheels is a function of having a car  ▪  There are some exceptions such as tukus    Based on this information it can be trained into an algorithm  Training and Evaluation data    During the training phase of the algorithm, requires splitting data into training and evaluation    data Since we know the relationship between input and output data, we are able to manipulate/refine features to train the model.  Mathematical Definition    Translate questions into formulas; Training data includes output information (labels/targets)  o  Target Function ▪  𝑓: 𝑋 → 𝑌  o  Examples  ▪  (𝑥, 𝑦) where it can be denoted as (𝑥1, 𝑦1),…… (𝑥𝑛, 𝑦𝑛)  o  Hypothesis  ▪  𝑔: 𝑋 → 𝑌 such that g(x) = f(x)  o  x  o  y  ▪  set of attribute values  ▪  discrete label (classification), a real-valued number regression  Types of Supervised Learning    Classification problems   o In a supervised learning problem with 2 classes, decision boundaries are hyper-surface that partition data space into 2 sets. o  Divide data based on trained algorithm.  o    Regression Problems  o  Examine the relationship between response of variables and one or more predictor  variables  o  Hyperplanes; regression analysis    7 Steps of Machine learning  o  Gathering Data o  Preparing that data choosing a model o  Training Evaluation o  Hyperparameter Tuning o  Prediction  Un-Supervised Learning Clustering    Grouping similar points together = relative similarity points between points    E.g it can find the trips around the city of less than 25kms and more than 25kms (2 clusters)   In some cases, when we might more clusters; more or less than 10km  Real world example    Netflix = predict user ratings for films   o  Training data set of 100, 480, 507 movie ratings that 480, 189 users gave to 17, 70  movies.    Purpose of having un-supervised ML for potential tasks include  Information retrieval  o o  Data compression o  Anomaly detection o  Data understanding and visualisation    Example of unsupervised learning o  Recommendation system  ▪  Amazon and online stores  Reinforcement Learning What is it?    An agent learns to behave in an environment by executing actions, through learning development  and experience from interactions; this is like how humans learn.    The agent acts in an environment and receives a form of validation after an action (reward),  however, is explained which action is the correct one for a desired goal.    E.g chess; if I leave the queen in a vulnerable spot on the board, I could potentially lose, which  could impact the game negatively. Therefore, I would not do it again.    An example of this could be finding the shortest path from one place to another; if I take a longer  root, then I would lose more time, otherwise if I take the most optimal route, I would gain more time (reward).  Reinforcement Learning Model Evaluation    Randomly split examples into training and test datasets   To learn = use training sets; evaluate the model using the test and measure the prediction  accuracy of certain process    Repeat the following, and determine the average performance  Model Selection    Finding the best model/hypothesis   This can be done by testing the time and space efficiency of an algorithm, in respect to the  complexity of the problem.    Look at averaged evaluation scores on many random test datasets   Cross – validation   Overfitting  o  In the case that a model learns the details and noise with a training dataset, it can negatively affect the model performance, if it is tested against a new dataset.  Mathematics and ML Areas    Vectors and basic vector operations   Matrices and matrix operations   Basic concept of probability  Vectors Why is math required    Understand the most optimal models and when and where specific ones can be used   Feature vectors  o  Most resource such as text documents, images, audio files, are examples of data objects,  and data can be stored in the form of vectors (due to the expansive nature).
