This topic covered fundamentals concepts of machine learning which closely relates to how a human child learns as they grow. Various steps in machine learning starting from data acquisition to evaluation and visualization were covered leading to  different types of learning models:  supervised(labeled data), unsupervised(unlabelled data)  and reinforcement( learning from interactions). b. For dealing with the data various mathematical concepts including operations on  vectors and matrices were also covered with implementation in python. c. Having come to the end of topic 1, I have gained theoretical knowledge on machine learning concepts plus skills import data and perform various mathematical operations using python.
