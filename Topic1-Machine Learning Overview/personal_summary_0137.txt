   Real-world applications of Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning is used in many real- world applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and many others.    Definitions  of  ML: Machine  Learning  is  a  field  of  study  that  uses  statistical  techniques  to enable  computer  systems  to  learn  and  improve  from  experience,  without  the  necessity  to program.    Types  of  ML: There  are  three  types  of  Machine  Learning,  which  are  supervised  learning,  unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.    Unsupervised  learning: Unsupervised  learning  is  a  type  of  Machine  Learning  that  involves training  a  model  on  a  dataset  without  any  labels.  The  model  tries  to  find  patterns  and relationships in the data by itself.    Supervised learning: Supervised learning is a type of Machine Learning where the model is trained on labelled data. The model learns to connect inputs to outputs based on the given examples. Linear models: Linear models are Machine Learning models that assume a linear relationship between  the  input  and  output  variables.  Examples  include  linear  regression  and  logistic regression.      Nonlinear models: Nonlinear models are a type of Machine Learning model that assumes a nonlinear  relationship  between  the  input  and  output  variables.  Examples  include  decision trees and neural networks.    Model  assessment  and  selection: Model  assessment  and  selection  are  crucial  steps  in  the Machine Learning process. They involve evaluating different models and selecting the best one based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.    Vector,  Matrix  and  operations: Vectors  and  matrices  are  mathematical  structures  used extensively include  addition,  subtraction, multiplication,  and  division.  Matrix  operations  include  matrix  multiplication,  transpose, inverse, and determinant.  in  Machine  Learning.
