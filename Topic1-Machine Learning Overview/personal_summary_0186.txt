Machine Learning Fundamentals:  Machine learning is a subﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence that allows computers to understand pa(cid:425)erns and make decisions based on data without the need for explicit programming.  Machine learning has a wide range of practical uses, including fraud detection, natural language processing, recommendation systems, image recognition, and self-driving cars.  Machine Learning Varieties:  Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labelled data with a known intended output. Regression and classiﬁcation problems are two examples.  Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm discovers fundamental pa(cid:425)erns and structures in unlabeled data. Clustering and dimensionality reduction projects are two examples.  Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with its surroundings and getting feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Robotics and video games are two examples.  Techniques for evaluating models: Various techniques, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve, are used to evaluate the success of machine learning models.  Python fundamentals:  Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook Installation: Anaconda is a data science pla(cid:414)orm that includes Python as well as a suite of famous data science packages, including Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is a collaborative computing environment in which users can create, run, and share code.  Data types and functions in Python:  Python includes several built-in data structures, such as integers, ﬂoats, strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples.  Python provides a wide range of arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators for performing operations on data types such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation.  Loops and conditional statements:  Conditional statements: The if, elif, and else statements in Python are used to perform various actions depending on conditions.  Loops: Python has two kinds of loops, while and for loops. While loops iterate over a sequence or a range of numbers, while for loops repeat a piece of code as long as a condition is true.  Python method for matrix manipulation:  Slicing: Accessing elements of NumPy matrices and arrays: NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing that includes an eﬃcient array object and numerous array manipulation methods.  Code example 1: Shows how to get the ﬁrst column of a NumPy matrix with the A[:, 0] syntax, where A is the matrix and 0 is the number of the ﬁrst column.  Code sample 2: Demonstrates string slicing in Python using the [start:stop:step] syntax. This can be used to extract index-based portions of strings or lists.  Logical checks for obtaining numbers from matrices/arrays:  Code example 3 shows how to perform logical checks on matrix components and extract values based on a condition. Finding elements in a particular column that are greater than a certain value, for example.  For circles, use:  Code example 4 shows how to use NumPy's arange and reshape functions to build a 12x12 matrix. The code also illustrates how to print the matrix and its shape, as well as the number of rows and columns.  Code example 5: Shows how to use a for-loop to eﬀectively access each row of a matrix rather than depending on element references.  Summary of the reading list  Machine Learning Fundamentals  1.
