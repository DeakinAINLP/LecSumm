  The first module focuses on introducing machine learning, along with some of its  practical uses. It is followed by information about machine learning's stages, kinds, and algorithms. Next, it goes into the connection between ML and mathematics and how it truly depends on it. We first explored some of the fundamentals of vectors and matrices before working with Python to create machine learning approaches and algorithms. This synopsis briefly touches on each of these subjects.  MACHINE LEARNING (ML):-    Designing methods and models that allow machines to learn from data and make  predictions or judgements without explicit programming is the focus of the artificial intelligence subfield of machine learning. It is a fast expanding area of engineering study that has many real-world applications in areas including robotics, natural language processing, image recognition, and predictive analytics. The idea behind it is training the models with a tonne of prepared data and then testing them on a regular basis with new data large gauge performance efficacy.  STEPS OF ML:-    Data manipulation, analytics, and visualisation are the first two processes of machine learning, followed by evaluation. Preprocessing and cleaning data to make it ready for analysis is known as data manipulation. Analytics and visualisation involve the use of statistical models and algorithms to draw conclusions from data and produce visual representations of the outcomes. By contrasting predictions made by machine learning models with actual results, evaluation includes determining the precision and efficacy of these tools. To attain the best results, these iterative procedures need to be continuously improved and refined. In order to successfully integrate machine learning in engineering and other domains, these stages must be carried out correctly.  TYPES OF ML:-    A variety of strategies are used in machine learning to allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or judgements without explicit programming. supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are the three main methods used in machine learning.    Using labelled data, supervised learning includes training a machine learning model to forecast future outcomes based on input properties. With this method, the algorithm learns from a training dataset where each input has the appropriate output. It then applies expertise to infer future outcomes from fresh, unobserved data.    Unsupervised learning is the process of finding patterns or groupings in unlabeled data. When the result or target variable is unknown and the objective is to find hidden structures or relationships within the data, this technique is applied.    An agent can be trained to make decisions based on feedback from the environment  through reinforcement learning. The algorithm learns through trial and error, reinforcing successful outcomes and discouraging unsuccessful ones. Choosing which model to use is now a challenge and may present its own set of issues, but in many situations, the choice may be obvious.  MATHEMATICS IN ML    Since many of the methods and models used in ML are based on statistical and mathematical principles, mathematics is essential to machine learning. Linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and optimisation are some of the essential mathematical ideas employed in ML. We should be aware that the majority of the data used by machine learning (ML) is stored in different data instances, which are known as caled vectors, as data is one of the main reasons why we need ML. We utilise feature vectors in machine learning because they are the only ones that can convert real-world input to numerical values, such as when representing a bag of words in Python. Given that vectors are one-dimensional structures, we employ matrices, which are two-dimensional data structures used to perform various calculations and aggregations on the set of data stored as a matrix, to accommodate more kinds, variables, and attributes in a dataset. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, dot products, transposition, inverse, determinant, and other operations can be applied to matrices. The module content has addressed everything in detail and with examples.  PYTHON IN ML    The module teaches newcomers some fundamental concepts in Python  programming, beginning with data types, iterations, conditionals, and functions. The modules and packages that we'll be using are then listed after that. The first is numpy, which includes a wide variety of functions, techniques, and classes for working with variables, vectors, and matrices. Hence, to implement the mathematical functions in ML, we shall use Python functions.
