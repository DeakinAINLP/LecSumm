I was new to Machine Learning and throughout the first topic I gained knowledge on  what  does  Machine  Learning  means  and  the  basics  of  Machine  Learning.  By reading the content and other resources I have gained more knowledge on Python other than ML. I have started doing Python Project for Data Science Offered by IBM in Coursera which gave me the basic understanding of python and python libraries. Also, I start reading the book ‘Python for Data Analysis’ by Wes McKinney. There I have read more on python language basics and built-in data structures, functions, fields, and more about NumPy Library.  In  the  data  structured  I  read  about,  tuple,  list,  dictionary,  and  comprehensions. Under  the  functions  I’ve  learnt  about  returning  multiple  values,  anonymous functions,  generators  and  errors  and  exception  handling.  Also  with  the  NumPy library  I  start  doing  practical  as  the  book  guided  to  create  ndarrays,  perform arithmetic  operations  with  arrays,  Indexing  and  slicing,  transposing  and  swiping arrays. Also, I have started reading on Pandas library and data frames. I am planning to read and learn more about it in the coming topics.
