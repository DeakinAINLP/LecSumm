 Machine learning is a “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed,” (Samuel 1959). Machine learning is useful because of all the data available to us, making sense of everything faster than any human has the ability to. Some essential skills required for machine learning are knowing Python, and having knowledge of vectors, matrices, and probability. When developing something that uses machine learning, the work can be divided into three steps, step 1: data manipulation, the process of preparing the data, step 2: data analysis, mainly “finding relationships and correlations in order to design an accurate model based on the input data” and lastly step 3: evaluation and visualization, which is evaluating the performance of the system and refining from there.  Three main types of machine learning algorithms that were covered in the material, supervised learning which requires a labeled dataset, unsupervised learning requiring unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning, which learns by interacting with the environment.  Mathematics are a fundamental underlying part of machine learning, covered in this topic’s material include vectors and basic vector operations, matrices and matrix operations, and the basic concept of probability.  We learnt how to set up our development environment for Python 3, and learnt some fundamental programming knowledge, such as branching, functions, and iterating.
