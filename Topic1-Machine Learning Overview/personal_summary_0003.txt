Machine learning can be defined as a computer learning the correct output when given more data, with T tasks processed to produced P which progressively get closer to a desired result through the use of algorithms. The main features of machine learning that differentiate it from AI are that AI is a subset of machine learning  where  scientists  and  researchers  are  trying  to  use  machine  learning  for  AI  to  replicate  the human brain. Which means an AI model that is “good” at more than one task. The main types of machine learning (with their various subsets) are Supervised where each data point is  labelled  and  the  model  has  to  find  an  algorithm  to  map  back  to  each  data  point  and  result. Unsupervised where there are no labels and defined goals. The model in this case has to  “look for” interesting features that can be used to extrapolate meaning, and lastly a hybrid approach that has both labelled and unlabelled data used in training. Machine learning is a fascinating topic when you thin of al of the many ways in which it can be applied, and it is not just games and or AI! Marketing, medical imaging, text predictions, spam filtering plus many other use cases. If data needs to be labelled or categorised, than machine learning is more than likely the tool for the job. The python covered in this  module was very  basic, and  not much was learned. The  recap on matrix transformations however was appreciated to have the different types noted out for easy reference.
