 What is Machine Learning?  Machine learning is trying to understand the changes to the data, the model is updated  and changes  Steps in ML  Data Collection Clean and Prepare Data Train or Build Model Evaluate the model o Improve/Deploy Types of ML Algorithms  Unsupervised (for unlabeled data)  Clustering (similarity based)  Grouping similar points together Gives insight to underlying patterns of different groups Use cases: data understanding and visualisation, anomaly detection,  information retrieval, data compression  Supervised (for labeled data)  Learn a function (model) from data to relate the inputs with outputs  Build a function that tells us that if X input then Y output Estimate decision boundary that can differentiate the two types of classes i.e.,  dog/cat (type of set)  Reinforcement (not in this unit)  Model assessment and adjustment  Randomly split examples into training and test data Use training set to learn a model Evaluate the model using test set and a measurement Repeat for different random splits and average results More training data, more accuracy  Model selection  Which one is the best after the above analysis Look at averaged evaluation score on many random test sets Cross validation, train using one set and test on the other then rotate them Be aware of over fitting  Vector  Data instance is represented by a vector, a feature vector Attribute is number of qualities per data points i.e. patient ‘x’ with 20 qualities/features, is the same as this data point has 20 dimensions  Vector operations  Transpose (change from column to row) X^T Addition (add every element together must be same length)    Inner product (row vector and column vector, want to multiply corresponding element and then add, have to transpose row vector). Will give scalar value (single number).  Operations  Magnitude of length of a vector 2-norm of a vector P-norm of a vector  Similarity options  Euclidean distance between vector a and b (straight line distance  between two data points)  Cosine – a measure of angle between two vectors  Matrix  Column vector represents one patient with lots of rows (attributes) M (rows) x N (columns) MxN (square matrix where m=n) Diagonal matrix is always square, diagonal in data, other rows/cols is 0 Identity matrix same is diagonal, diagonal in data = all 1, other values 0 Transpose matrix (change dimension)  A -> A^T Column data move to row  Symmetric Matrices  A matrix is symmetric if equal to its own transpose Always square  Operations  Addition/subtraction (X + Y) Scalar multiplication or division (multiply each element of matrix by  scalar)  Elementwise matrix multiplication (matrices have the same size) Matrix to matrix  Number of cols in first matrix is equal to number of rows in  second matrix (must have)  Not commutative  Matrix A is called as inverse of matrix B if and only if BA =AB=1  Since AB=BA, both A and B need to be square matrix o o  If A is inverse of B… A = B^-1 Inverse of a matrix A exists only if its determinant is non-zero
