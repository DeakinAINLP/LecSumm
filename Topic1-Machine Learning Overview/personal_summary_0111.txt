 Machine Learning - As the name suggests machine learning is the ﬁeld of study where machine undertakes a tasks on its own on the basis of information/results provided to the machine.  Different types of Machine Learning  ● Supervised ML : In supervised learning we divide the dataset into two parts training data  and test data, where the most percentage of data is training data.In this case we map a  function x to y , it means we already know the function and by using that function we ﬁnd  the unknow. Quantity.  ○ It also has two types :  ■ Classiﬁcation Problems  ■ Regression  ● Unsupervised ML:In this type of algorithm the machine automatically, trains itself on  untagged data.  ● Renforcement Learning : It is one of the machine llearning algorithm in which the  machine creates it own neural network which then thinks like an artiﬁcial brains and  teaches its self to learn a particular task and if it corrects it give itself points and this  learning goes on for several generation.  Steps involved in ML  ● Data Collection  ● Data Cleaning  ● Train the model  ● Test Data  ● Evaluate the model  2 Model Evaluation  After doing all these steps its time to decide whether we choose the correct model or not, to test  this we need to see the model accuracy which is very important.Because future instances  have unknown label values, we need to check the accuracy of a machine learning model  on test data with correct labels that we already know
