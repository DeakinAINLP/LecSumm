  What is an algorithm?    An algorithm is a set of instructions.   Computers need precise instructions to perform tasks   Algorithms are like cooking recipes   Definition of machine learning  A computer program is said to learn from experience E about a class of tasks T and performance measures P. If performance on a task within T is improved by experience E, as measured by P   (Applying machine learning to the real world) robotics    computer vision   Board game   voice recognition   mathematics awareness   Etc   Machine learning procedures   Step1 Data manipulation  The first step in data manipulation is data acquisition. Data acquisition is the process of sampling information describing real-world physical conditions using predefined measurements. Unusable parts should be removed. This procedure is called data cleaning. Data cleaning is an important step, as real-world datasets are highly susceptible to noise, redundancies, and missing values. Tricycles are very rare and may be removed.    Step2 Analysis  The second major step in machine learning is analytics. Analysis is primarily about finding relationships and correlations in prepared data and designing accurate models based on that input data. Furthermore, exploratory data analysis is an approach for analyzing datasets and summarizing their main features and functions. Many exploratory data analysis methods use visual delineation of data based on various features. Graphs, charts, tables, etc. make data easier to understand. Finally, predictive machine learning is the final stage of his analytics. Use various statistical techniques such as predictive modeling to build classifiers or intelligent systems for decision making.    Step3 Evaluation and visualization  The end result of Analytics is an intelligent system or model.         If the quality and performance of the intelligent system does not achieve satisfactory results, refinement procedures are required, requiring another round of data manipulation and analysis. This unit focuses primarily on the Analyze step. However, you need to build the model using some of the data manipulation steps.   An overview of supervised learning  Supervised learning can be defined as: A function (also called a model) is learned from data to relate inputs to known outputs. One of the defining characteristics of supervised learning is that the dataset has the relationships built in from the beginning. For supervised learning, training requires splitting the available data into her training and evaluation data. Most of the data is used for developing and training the function "model". I know the relationship between input and output. Machine algorithms must be described mathematically. Computers understand numbers, so they need to transform the question into a formula or algorithm so they can process the answer.   Overview of unsupervised learning clustering  Clustering is the process of grouping similar points together. The goal of this unsupervised machine learning technique is to find the relative similarities of data points. It gives you insight into the underlying patterns and different groups in your dataset.   Reinforcement learning  Like chess, there are many logic games that involve a series of decisions. You can train agents to learn how to play chess through reinforcement learning. When actions and corresponding rewards are clearly defined. For example, moving a queen to a vulnerable square removes it from the board.   Model evaluation and selection  1.  Randomly split the sample into a training dataset and a test dataset 2.  Train the model using the training dataset 3.  Repeat for different random splits evaluating the model using the test dataset and measurements (such as accuracy of prediction) and average the results. 4.  Check the accuracy of the results and retry (iterate) until the model makes useful  predictions  If you remember clustering problems, you can't know the best, most accurate, or most useful model because you don't know the exact number of clusters. The model you choose directly affects the quality of your output.  As the model learns the details and noise in the training dataset, that knowledge can adversely affect the model's performance on new datasets. In machine learning, this is called "overfitting". This means that designing a model around the training dataset can lead to poor performance on evaluation and new data.            vector Visually, vector quantities have both magnitude and direction, but they are actually a series of related numbers. Roles in ML are about relationships between data objects. Vectors have three main operations. As we have seen, vectors can be represented as single-column matrices. 1.  Transpose 2.  Add 3.  Internal product   distance between vectors  Cosine similarity is a similarity function that is often useful for information retrieval. Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Cosine similarity is therefore defined as a measure of similarity between two vectors in the inner product space. Cosine distance, on the other hand, measures the angular difference between two vectors. In other words, we do this by subtracting the similarity from 1, since the cosine distance tries to represent vector dissimilarity in positive space.   special matrices  The representation of a set of documents as vectors is known as the vector space model. This is the basic step of any information retrieval operation. These operations range from simple query problems to actual search engines. In the text data representation step, we had two documents with corresponding feature vectors. We can easily find the distance between these two documents by calculating the Euclidean distance. This can be used as a quick way to find the proximity of two documents.   Basic functions of Python  1.  Interpretation: processed at runtime 2.  Interactive: using the Python prompt 3.  Object Oriented: Encapsulate your code in objects. Language suitable for  beginners  4.  Easy to remember: few keywords, simple structure, clear syntax 5.  Easy to read and maintain 6.  Extensive standard library: portable across UNIX, Windows and Mac 7.  Major database support 8.  GUI programming support   Branching and decision  Syntax (indentation in this case) and conditions (decisions) are two other important aspects of coding. Python code blocks are defined by their indentation level. The structure of your program is controlled by how much you indent the lines of code. right or wrong The answer is "boolean". A digital bit is either on or off.   Iteration        Loops or iterations can be programmed using: for and while.for loops are used to iterate over Python objects such as lists, arrays and tuples. A for loop executes a fixed number of times, also called iterations.   functions  Functions store blocks of code so you can call them by name. Functions in Python are defined using keywords. followed by the function name and function arguments in parentheses () and ending with a colon:  Functional Python code follows, adding one level of indentation Anonymous functions are defined by the keyword lambda in Python. Functions to f and g do essentially the same thing in the cell below. But g is an anonymous function.   Python modules and packages  Like many other programming languages, Python lets you store useful function definitions in files. You can then import it as a module into your current program.
