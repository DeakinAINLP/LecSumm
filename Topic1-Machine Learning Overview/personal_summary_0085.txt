Introduction to Machine Learning  Machine learning can be broken down into three steps.  ● Data Manipulation  ○ Data acquisition ○ Data Storage ○ Data cleaning  ● Analytics  ○ Finding relationships ○ Exploratory data analysis ○ Predictive machine learning  ● Evaluation and Visualization  Supervised Learning It is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data to make predictions on new, unseen data. The labeled data consists of input variables and their corresponding output variables, and the model learns to predict the output variable from the input variable. Supervised learning has been used extensively in image classification tasks, where the goal is to classify images into different categories. Image classification has lent itself as a useful product of supervised learning to the medical field, medical imaging results can be analyzed by models and be given information based on the observed results. ______________________________________________________________________  Unsupervised Learning It is a type of machine learning where the model learns to find patterns or structure in the data without any prior knowledge of the output variable. The data is not labeled and the model learns to group or cluster similar data points based on their similarities. One real-life use case where unsupervised learning has been applied is in Google News. Google News uses unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster news articles into related groups. This clustering is done based on the similarity of the articles' content, without any prior labeling or categorization. ______________________________________________________________________  Reinforcement Learning It is a type of machine learning where the model learns from trial and error by interacting with an environment. The model learns to take actions that maximize a cumulative reward signal by exploring and exploiting the environment. Another example of RL is the use of autonomous vehicles in the transportation industry. RL algorithms are used to train autonomous vehicles to navigate complex environments and make decisions in real-time based on sensor data. ______________________________________________________________________  Model Evaluation and Selection It is the process of evaluating and selecting the best model among a set of candidate models. This is typically done by splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the models on the training set, and evaluating their performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. ______________________________________________________________________  Mathematics and ML Mathematics is fundamental to machine learning as it provides the underlying theory and concepts for understanding the algorithms and models used in machine learning. Linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and statistics are some of the key mathematical concepts used in machine learning. ______________________________________________________________________  Vectors and its operations A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. Vectors can be added, subtracted, and multiplied by scalars to perform various operations like scaling, rotation, and projection. ______________________________________________________________________  Distances between vectors The distance between two vectors is a measure of their dissimilarity or similarity. There are various distance metrics like Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and cosine similarity that are commonly used in machine learning. ______________________________________________________________________  Matrix Algebra A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers. Matrix algebra involves operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion of matrices. These operations are used extensively in machine learning for tasks like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
