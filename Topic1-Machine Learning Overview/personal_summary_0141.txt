The main points covered in this topic are all about what is algorithm, what is machine learning and where it is applied, steps of machine learning, supervised learning and its types, approaches for unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, vector and matrix operations. Then we started to learn basics of python code such as variables, list, tuple, dictionary, branching statements, different packages and implementing vector and matrix operations in python.
