TOPIC 1: INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING  TOPIC 1: INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING  Understanding the various definition of machine learning and its comparison to   simple computer program.  Application of machine learning in real world that includes robotics, board games,   computer visions, healthcare analytics, voice recognition, digit recognition, stock market prediction.    Steps of machine learning in problem solving and decision making  Supervised learning in machine learning, it’s definition or description and different   types of supervised learning.  Machine learning that uses supervised learning in real life, weather forecasting,   customer discovery  Description of unsupervised learning, different approaches in unsupervised learning   that is clustering and factor analysis.  Potential tasks for Machine learning unsupervised learning and real-life examples of   machine learning that uses unsupervised learning.  Understanding of reinforcement learning as a type of machine learning algorithm and   its application in machine learning.  Model evaluation and selection in machine learning problems, understanding the   differences between training, validation, and test dataset.    ●  ● matrix.    Mathematical concept in machine learning, this includes.  Vectors and its operation, distance between vectors  Matrix algebra and its basic operations, special matrices including vector space  Understanding of Python and the basic features of python  Setting up python that is downloading and installing the anaconda distribution of   python 3.            Learning different types of variables, basic coding, inserting comments.  Branching and decisions concept, conditional and decision trees  The concept of iterations or loops, that is using ‘for’ and ‘while’ in programming.  Understanding of functions that store blocks of code to be called by name.  Understanding the concept of python modules and packages.  Using the NumPy package, creating vectors and matrices and performing linear   algebra operations on the data. This involved running of numerous codes.  Understanding of how matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and   division) are implemented in Python using the NumPy library.  Learning the useful matrix manipulation code in python that is slicing, logical checks   to extract values from matrices.
