Topic one of the course covered several essential topics related to machine learning. Firstly, it provided an overview of machine learning and its practical applications in real-world scenarios. The different machine-learning techniques were also discussed, including  supervised,  unsupervised,  and  reinforcement  learning.  Furthermore,  the course  also  included  an  introduction  to  model  evaluation.  Additionally,  basic  linear algebra operations and their implementation in Python were taught. The fundamental concepts of the Python language, such as iterations, functions, and variables, were also explained. Finally, the backbone of the machine learning language, the numpy module,  was  described  in  detail,  emphasising  its  importance  in  mathematical operations within machine learning and other fields.
