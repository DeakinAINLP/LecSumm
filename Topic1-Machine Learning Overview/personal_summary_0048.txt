We ﬁrst learnt about machine learning and its meaning. I learnt that machine learning in  principle is what gives computers that ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. For example learning from experience in respect to a task and measured against its performance.   We learnt about supervised learning. Supervised learning in essence is having some sort  of input such as dataset to learn from in order to relate input to known outputs.   Unsupervised learning is basically the same as supervised but without labels of the data  and tries to ﬁnd the relationships purely base doin the data.   Reinforcement learning is another machine learning algorithm which trains an “agent”  based on regarding good behaviour and punishing undesired behaviour.   We then learnt about vectors. They are fundamental to linear algebra. In general vectors  have both a magnitude and direction, and feature vectors are used to represent numeric or symbolic characteristics, and they are called features.   We then learnt about matrix algebra, and how to accomplish matrix addition and  subtraction, and the diﬀerent forms of matrix multiplication, such as element wise and matrix to matrix.  I also learnt about matrix transposition and there diﬀerences between symmetric, diagonal and identity matrix.  I then began to set up python with jupyter notebook and learnt the many types of variable oﬀered in python.  I then learnt the basics of of python such as iterations and block statements
