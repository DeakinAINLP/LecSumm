This topic's task required us to complete a series of python related exercises to demonstrate our understanding of, and ability to use the methods covered in this module. I found the task straightforward as I have a reasonable understanding of python, numpy and a number of other libraries.  Defining Machine Learning (ML) & ML Applications  Machine Learning (ML) is a set of tools that enables computers to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML involves processing data (experience) using tasks to improve performance and achieve a desired result (performance measure).  Real-world applications of ML include robotics, computer vision, board games, voice recognition, digit recognition, healthcare analytics, stock market prediction, business analytics, and facial recognition.  Machine Learning Steps  Machine learning involves three main steps: data manipulation, analytics, and evaluation/visualization.  Data manipulation involves acquiring and cleaning data and preparing it for analysis. Analytics involves finding relationships and correlations in the data, using exploratory data analysis and predictive machine learning. Finally, evaluating and visualizing the performance of the intelligent system or model produced by the analytics step.  More than likely, refinement of the process will be required through additional rounds of data manipulation and analytics.  Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning  Supervised learning is where a model learns from the labeled data or target outputs provided to predict outcomes.  Unsupervised learning is where a model learns from unlabeled data to identify patterns and relationships.  Reinforcement learning is where a model learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments to optimize its behavior.  Model Evaluation & Selection  It is important to evaluate a model's ability to predict labels on new and future test data. This is done by randomly splitting the data into a training dataset and a test dataset, using the training data to learn a model, evaluating the model using the test data, and repeating for different random splits.  The best model or best-fit hypothesis is often difficult to determine, so many different models are tried out using methods such as cross-validation. Over-fitting can occur when a model learns the details and noise within a training dataset, resulting in poor performance on evaluation or new data.   Vectors and Matrices  Vectors and matrices are used to represent, manipulate, and transform data and are fundamental to machine learning. As such this module provided a refresher for basic vector and matrix mathematics.  Python Basics  Finally, the module concluded with a basic python tutorial covering how to set up the environment, basic python operations, and some basic vector and matrix operations using numpy.
