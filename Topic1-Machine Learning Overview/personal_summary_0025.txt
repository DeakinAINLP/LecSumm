 Learn the basic concept of machine learning and its type including supervised learning (regression and classiﬁcaAon), unsupervised learning (clustering), and reinforcement learning.  -  Understand the three main stages of machine learning and its sub-stagess including data manipulaAon (data acquisiAon, data storage, and data cleaning), analyAcs (ﬁnd relaAonship and correlaAons, exploratory data analysis, and predicAve machine learning), and model evaluaAon, selecAon, and visualizaAon.  -  Explore vector, matrix, and some of its operaAons including matrix addiAon/subtracAon/mulAplicaAon/division, elementwise matrix mulAplicaAon, matrix to matrix mulAplicaAon, transpose, inverse, and orthogonal of matrix, and symmetric/diagonal/idenAty matrix. Implement basic Python programming with NumPy library including matrix addiAon, subtracAon, mulAplicaAon, and division.
