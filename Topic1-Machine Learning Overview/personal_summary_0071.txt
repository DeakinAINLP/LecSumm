In topic 1, we covered the basics and introduction into the vast world of Machine Learning. These core areas include:  -  Defining what machine learning is, and the real-world applications where machine learning is required. This area of topic 1 had us learn about the definition of machine learning (a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed), and the refinement method and steps, which included: data manipulation, analytics, and evaluation + visualization. We also learnt about the stages within data manipulation, which included the acquisition of data, the storage of data and data cleaning.  -  The different methods of machine learning techniques, such as supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. This section included the explanation of supervised learning (learns from data to relate inputs to known outputs) and the different types of supervised learning, which included;  -  Classification problems: predicting the categorical class or label of a data point -  Regression problems: predicting a continuous numerical value. -  We also learnt about unsupervised learning (using algorithms to analyze data clusters from data sets that are unlabeled), and the two popular approaches to this learning function (model), which were clustering and factor analysis (grouping similar points together, identify underlying factors or latent variables, respectfully). The final model in machine learning we learnt about was reinforcement learning, which is an algorithm that learns to behave in an environment from interactions and is said to replicate how humans learn.  -  -  Mathematics that are required for Machine Learning. This entailed vectors, calculating the  distance between vectors, matrices and matrix algebra and special matrices, such as a vector space model, which is used with text data representation.
