This topic session started the foundation of machine learning, which started with the essential skills and concepts, I got to learn about the basics machine learning and its real world application. Machine learning is supervised and unsupervised, we learned Linear and non-linear models. We learned about best model selection, vector operations, matrix types and their operations and probability. Other than this we gained knowledge about the python and other tools.  Machine learning is defined as an act of sensing, processing and creating result through the learning process by watching, listening, learning and storing in the machine database, so that this information can be processed for creating the optimal result. This process involves different algorithms and models. Machine learning is used in computer vision, robotics, board games, voice, digit and facial recognition.  Supervised learning is done on the basis of labeled data, in this the algorithm learns to map input data to correct the output data so as to achieve minimal error. Unsupervised machine learning is used to find the patterns in the data without any supervision, it tries to identify the underlying structure or relationship in the data. Clustering and dimension reduction are the most common types, clustering groups similar data points together as per their features, whereas dimension reduction reduces number of features in dataset and retains required information. Model selection is done on the basis of classification accuracy.  Reinforcement learning is a way to learn on the basis of feedback with a goal to maximize cumulative reward over time. It is policy based and value based, in value based the information is used to  choose the best action to maximize expected future reward, whereas policy based learn direct mapping from states to actions. Reinforcement learning has been successful in so many areas specially where we need to study the unsupervised data.
