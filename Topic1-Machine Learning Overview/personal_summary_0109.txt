In the first topic of 2 formal classes and workshops, I was introduced to Machine Learning. First, we  were  introduced  to  and  covered  various  elements  of  machine  learning,  such  as  supervised learning  and  unsupervised  learning,  including  classification,  regression  for  both  linear  and nonlinear  problems,  and  unsupervised  learning  monitoring  to  reduce  the  clustering  dimension. Then, we were covered the fundamentals of machine learning and went through model evaluation and selection, which is what and includes vectors, metrics, and operations for those. I was also introduced to math operations like vectors and matrices, how they work, and why we must learn them when learning Machine Learning. Last but very important, in this course, we are introduced to the Python programming language, the only programming language in this Machine Learning course.
