 In this module we were introduced machine learning terminology and its techniques which we will learn about in the future modules. We were also given a brief recap about python fundamentals and its uses in machine learning.  Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn. It is a set of tools to derive meaning from data.  Real world applications of machine learning include robotics, computer vision, board games, voice recognition.  There are steps to machine learning: -  Step 1 data manipulation: In this process we acquire the data, clean it so that it doesn’t have noisy or unusable parts.  Step 2 analytics: in this step we mainly try to find relationships and correlations in the prepared data to design an accurate model based on the input data.  We also perform exploratory data analysis, where we try and represent data’s main characteristics or features in the form of graphs and charts etc.  Step 3 Evaluation and visualisation: After making an intelligent model, we evaluate the model’s performance and if the model is not up to mark, we start the refinement process which involves all the steps above repeated to refine the model.  Another important definition I found from external sources of machine learning:  “Machine learning is writing software that can learn from past experiences.”         Supervised learning:  Supervised learning is learning a function from data to relate inputs to known outputs. It is trained which means the relationship between dataset and output is already defined.  There are two types of supervised learning classification and regression.  Unsupervised learning:  When data is provided but without any additional data about the data. That is considered unsupervised learning. Popular approaches include clustering and factor analysis.  Reinforcement learning:  It is another type of machine learning, in this an agent or a model learns by doing an action and receiving feedback on said action, but then is not told if the action was correct, the feedback changes how the agent performs. It is close to how humans learn.  Model evaluation is where we evaluate a model to find the best fit which will provide accurate predictions.  After this we looked at mathematical concepts such as vectors matrices and we also investigated python and its features and fundamentals.
