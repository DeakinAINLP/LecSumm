MACHINE LEARNING  Topic 1 review  I had no previous knowledge about Machine Learning until I started with this unit. I learned the basic idea of machine learning and its diﬀerent classiﬁcations. There are 3 machine learning techniques – supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. These concepts were initially very hard for me to understand, but there where various materials provided in the learning resources. Through the videos and links I got the idea of Machine Learning techniques. I went through few real-world applications where machine learning is used and that helped me in understanding more. A(cid:332)er the basic introduction, I had to understand how to select the best ﬁtted model suited to give the required output. I went through the module and became quite familiar with the process. I learned that we use most of the data for training and keep the rest for testing purpose. The more the training data, less will be the errors.  Now the part came where I had to correlate Machine Learning with the fundamentals of Mathematics. I  questioned myself “how is math related to machine learning?”, and I got the answer while reading through the modules. So it seems every data we use had to be represented as a vector. So now I had to revise the concepts of Matrix. We learned it in out high school, so I did not have to put a lot of eﬀort in understanding it. Every basic concept of Matrix was clearly explained in the module. I found it interesting when I started using this knowledge with python program. Through all the codes provided and the tasks given, I gained more ideas about machine learning. But I learned a little bit more about python functions through trial-and-error method. I was inquisitive about the change in the output if a small portion of the code was changed. I refer W3school website for python programming. The greater part of learning is from the classes and the workshops.
