Main learning points:  Machine learning steps are:  1.  Data manipulation:  o  Data acquisition and cleaning  2.  Analytics:  o  exploring the data from in terms of analysing relationships. ▪  That is, understanding the features before modelling  o  Creating a predictive model  3.  Evaluation and visualisation:  o  Evaluate the model’s performance and refine it by retracing the above  steps if necessary.    Supervised learning’s two types:  o  Classification o  Regression  ▪  Can result in a hyperplane, where datapoints are on one side or  another.  ▪  A hyperplane is something with one less dimension than the  number of features.    For example, a 2D shape when the regression is 3- dimensional or a line when the regression is 2- dimensional.    Unsupervised (works with unlabelled data) learning’s popular approaches:  o  Clustering o  Factor analysis    Reinforcement learning:  o  Machine interacts with the environment and receives evaluation based  on its action.  When evaluating a model:    The random train/test split is iterated through multiple times. The average  accuracy score of each iteration is noted. Then the random train/test split is iterated through again.    There is also cross validation, which iteratively resamples the data for  training/test.  Maths and matrices:    The 2-norm of a vector is the Euclidean distance.    xTy = x.dot(y) where x and y are vectors  Inner product is the dot product (at least for our context):    Cosine similarity:  Is for positive values only.  o o  Cosine similarity ranges from 0 to 1 inclusive. o  Cosine distance measures dissimilarity:  ▪  1-cosine_similarity.
