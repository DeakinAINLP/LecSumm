The ﬁrst sec>on dealt with the deﬁni>on of ML and how it has changed over >me. A succinct way of understanding ML is as a systems ability to adapt and react in its responses external factors in a meaningful and useful way.  So a car set to cruise control is ﬁxed programming, once  the  speed  is  set  it  stays  constant  –  whereas  if  the  vehicle  is  able  to  adjust  to  certain variables (such proximity of other vehicles) so that alters the required speed, this could be thought of as primi>ve machine learning.  Even the car is able to retain this data and use it for future trips to adjust speed in an improved manner, this is more closer to ML in the modern context.  The steps required for machine learning to occur where covered, namely:  Data Manipula+on: Data Acquisi>on. Data Storage, Data Cleaning  Analy+cs: Correla>ons, Exploratory Data Analysis, Predic>ve Machine learning  Evalua+on and Visualisa+on:  System Evalua>on and Reﬁnement  Supervised  and  Unsupervised  learning  were  introduced,  the  former  being  based  upon labelled data sets (which provides a basis for rela>onship) while the laUer uses unlabelled data.  Reinforcement learning is another algorithm used to adapt behaviour based on interac>ons.  Model  evalua>on  selec>on  was  also  introduced  and  the  dangers  of  over  ﬁVng,  which essen>ally  backwards  looking  rather  than  forward  looking  –  that  is,  the  model  >ghtly conforms to what has happened but in fact is not useful for predic>ve purposes because it is too >ght ﬁVng.  The rest of the unit focused on some of the mathema>cal founda>ons of ML such as vectors and  matrices  –  and  common  opera>ons  that  can  be  performed  on  them  (such  as  vector transposing, magnitude, cosine similarity and matric algebra).  Finally basic Python syntax and opera>ons where introduced.
