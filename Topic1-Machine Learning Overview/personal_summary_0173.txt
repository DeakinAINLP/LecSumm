Main points summary:  -  Definition of machine learning. What differs ML from a simple computer program is  the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  -  Real world applications of ML: Can be used in many different areas. -  Supervised learning overview. The majority of practical ML uses supervised learning, which is relating inputs to labeled outputs, in contrast to unsupervised learning where the outputs are unknown. There are two types of supervised learning, classification and regression. Regression is used to predict continuous values while classification is used to classify discrete values.  -  Unsupervised learning overview. Find patterns within an unlabeled dataset. Two popular approaches in unsupervised learning are clustering and factor analysis. Clustering is the process of grouping similar inputs together.  -  Reinforcement learning. In this type of machine learning, an agent is learning by  performing actions and learning from interactions. It is similar to how humans learn from instinct and experimentation.  -  Model evaluation and selection. The goal with learning your model is to minimize the expected error on future test data. Therefore, one can’t only minimize the model’s error on the training dataset, as this will most likely overfit the model and not generalize well to unseen data. A way to avoid overfitting is to repeatedly split the data into training and test datasets, and then averaging the results. It is also important to try different kinds of models, as there is no easy way to know if a certain model will offer the best fit. -  Basic mathematics and machine learning:  o  Vectors and vector operations o  Matrices and matrix operations o  Probability  -  Python basics.
