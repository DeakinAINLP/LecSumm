Tristen Clifton 221211319 SIT307 (Topic 1)  Summarize the main points that is covered in this topic.  An algorithm is a set of instructions, In computer terms this is a precise set of instructions given to a computer to perform a task.  We explored the definitions of machine learning by looking at two quotes.  “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed,”  “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E,”  We then discussed the applications of machine learning, in the fields of robotics, computer vision voice recognition, digit recognition, and beating “games”.  We discussed the process required for machine learning, being data manipulation, analytics and then evaluation and visualization.  We discussed the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning, that be where supervised learning is provided labeled data to work from.  We also discussed reinforcement learning where a machine learns my receiving reward and or punishment for actions taken.  We also discussed fitting models to data, and how overfitting data can cause a machine to be inaccurate as its looking for exact copies of the learning data rather than what is close.
