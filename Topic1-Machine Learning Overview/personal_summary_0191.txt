During the topic one main topics has been covered are Introduction to machine learning and machine learning concepts (ie. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning..etc), Mathematical concepts using in Machine Learning and usage of Python Programming in Machin Learning.  Specially the mathematics concepts like Probability, Regression and Vectors concepts are the core of machine learning. Also, how to apply this mathematical concept to build various Machin Learning concepts like Supervise and unsupervised learning concepts.  In summery the topic one module covers mainly the usage of this fundamental concepts and Python Programming usage for Machine Learning.
