 This topic's main topics focused on the practical applications of Machine Learning (ML), a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML involves using algorithms to recognize patterns from data  and  make  predictions  without  being  programmed  to  do  so  explicitly.  We  discussed different types of ML, including supervised and unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning involves  identifying  patterns  and  relationships  in  data  without  any  prior  labelling,  while supervised  learning  relies  on  labelled  examples  to  make  predictions.  Within  supervised learning, we looked at two types of models: linear and nonlinear, which use different techniques to make predictions based on input data. Finally, we discussed various methods to assess and select the best ML model, such as cross-validation and performance metrics, and highlighted the importance of avoiding overfitting and underfitting to ensure accurate predictions on new data.
