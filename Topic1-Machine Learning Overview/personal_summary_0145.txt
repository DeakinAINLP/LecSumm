  Summary  o  Real World of Applications of Machine Learning (ML): Machine learning offers a wide range of real-world applications in a variety of sectors. Examples include healthcare,  where  it  can  be  used  for  disease  detection  and  patient  outcome prediction; finance, where it can be used for fraud detection, risk assessment, and  investment  management;  retail,  where  it  can  be  used  for  personalised shopping and customer engagement; transportation, where it can be used to optimise  systems  and  reduce  costs;  manufacturing,  where  it  can  be  used  to improve  product  quality;  and  entertainment,  where  it  can  be  used  to personalise  content  recommendations.  In  the  future,  ML  is  projected  to  find even more applications.  o  Definitions  of  ML:  Machine  learning  is  a  subfield  of  artificial  intelligence  that focuses on developing methods and models that enable computer systems to learn  and  improve  without  explicit  programming.  ML  algorithms  can  analyse data,  discover  patterns,  forecast outcomes,  and  categorise  things.  Image  and audio  recognition,  natural  language  processing,  predictive  analytics,  and autonomous systems are all applications of machine learning.  o  Types of ML  ▪  Unsupervised  Learning:  Unsupervised  learning  is  a  machine  learning approach for detecting patterns and correlations in data without the use of  labelled  samples.  To  identify  hidden  structures  or  insights  inside  the data, the algorithm must find patterns and groups on its own. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are two common strategies. When there is no  labelled  data  available  or  the  data  is  too  complicated  to  classify manually, unsupervised learning is beneficial. Anomaly detection, market segmentation,  picture  and  audio  recognition,  and  natural  language processing are some of the applications.  ▪  Supervised Learning    Linear  Models:  Linear  models  are  a  type  of  statistical  modelling used in machine learning. They use a linear equation to represent the  connection  between  a  dependent  variable  and  one  or  more independent variables. Linear models are based on the assumption of  a  linear  connection  between  input  data  and  output  variables. Linear regression is the most basic type of linear model, in which the  value  of  the  dependent  variable  is  predicted  based  on  the values of the independent variables. Other forms of linear models used for binary and multiclass classification issues include logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis. Linear models may also be  used  to  choose  features.  They  have  several  applications  in finance,  healthcare,  marketing,  and  social  sciences,  and  they  are simple to understand.     Nonlinear  Models:  Nonlinear  models  are  a  machine  learning approach  that  uses  a  nonlinear  function  to  represent  the connection  between  a  dependent  variable  and  one  or  more independent  variables.  Nonlinear  models,  as  opposed  to  linear models,  do  not  assume  a  linear  relationship  between  input characteristics  and  output  variables,  allowing  them  to  capture more  complicated  interactions.  They  can  be  more  difficult  to comprehend than linear models, but in some instances, they can yield  more  accurate  forecasts.  Polynomial  regression  and  neural networks  are  two  examples  of  nonlinear  models.  Several  uses of nonlinear  models  include  picture  and  audio  recognition,  natural language processing, and financial modelling.  o  Model Assessment and Selection: The evaluation and selection of models are critical  elements  in  the  machine  learning  process.  Model  evaluation  is  the process of evaluating the performance of a machine learning model using a set of  metrics,  whereas  model  selection is  the  process  of  comparing  the performance of many models and choosing the best one. Cross-validation and grid search are two techniques used for model evaluation and selection. A high- performing model can give significant insights and assist decision-making, but a low-performing model can result in false forecasts and waste of resources.

My  reflections:  This  topic  we  were  introduced  to  machine  learning  and  it’s  uses  in present  world  along  with  what  it  means  by  machine  learning.  We  learned  about different types of machine learning like supervised and unsupervised learning. Under supervised learning we learned about linear and non-linear models. Then we learned about the process of evaluating the models and based on these evaluations a model is selected. Apart from this we also learned about vector and matrix algebra.
