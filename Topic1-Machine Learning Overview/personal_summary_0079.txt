In this topic, we have come around some of the basics about Machine Learning. Machine Learning or (ML for short) is deﬁned as ﬁeld of study where computers could learn without explicitly programmed. It learns from some experience E with respect to some tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. Some of its real-world applicaFons include in the ﬁeld of RoboFcs, Computer Vision, Speech RecogniFon, Board games etc. We later learned about the kind of steps a ML Algorithm usually takes; some of the main stages include Data ManipulaFon, Data AnalyFcs, and Data VisualizaFon.  Secondly, we learned about some of the three main types of ML Algorithms: namely Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. Supervised Learning allows an ML Algorithm learns from the data to relate Inputs with Outputs. Unsupervised Learning uses unlabelled data to separate instances into clusters or groups. And ﬁnally, reinforcement learning is the type of Machine Learning which allows an agent to learn from an environment and receive some feedback because of that acFon. In ML we aim to evaluate a model to determine if the algorithm is suitable for the dataset provided. Speaking of dataset, we divide it into training and tesFng subsets. To select the best suitable model, we will compare various models based on the performance parameters and someFmes we will also adjust each model’s hyperparameters.  Thirdly, we learned that ML algorithms are based on Maths. In fact, most of the algorithms are based on basic concepts like Vectors, Matrices, and Probability. We learned some of the basics of Vectors where we learned about some of the essenFal operaFons, like addiFon, TransposiFon, Inner product, and Euclidean distance between two vectors. Likewise, we about the basic operaFons for Matrices like Matrix AddiFon (/SubtracFon), Matrix MulFplicaFon, Scalar MulFplicaFon (/Division), Element-wise MulFplicaFon, Matrix-to- Matrix MulFplicaFon etc. With Basic operaFons, we also learned about some of the basic kinds of matrices as well.  Finally, we learned about the basics of Python Programming and the installaFon of the environment (I aim to use Google Collab for this subject!). We came around the basic concepts of Python like the types of variables (strings, integers, ﬂoat), data types (lists, tuples, dicFonary), condiFonals and decision trees and iteraFons etc. We then also came around bigger concepts like FuncFons, Modules, and Packages. Using python, we also came around data manipulaFon with the NumPy library.
