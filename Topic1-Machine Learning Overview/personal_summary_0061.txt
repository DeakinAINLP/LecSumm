  An algorithm a defined set of instructions to be performed by the computer    Machine learning is defined as the use of data and algorithms to replicate the manner in  which human beings learn and with more experience and tasks that the machine performs,  the more accurate it gets in terms of its learning and its ability to predict    As mentioned,    The need for machine learning arises from the large and vast amount of data available and  being created every second.    Machine  learning  has  numerous  applications  which  include  robotics  (in  terms  of  daily  chores  etc),  computer  vision  ,  board  games,  voice  recognition  and  digit  recognition  amongst others       All  of  the  steps  of  machine  learning  can  simply  be  summarised  as  follows:    Supervised  learning  already  has  some  sort  of  label  on  the  given  dataset  whereas  unsupervised  learning  is  where  we  have  to  perform  clustering  to  find  patterns  to  group  similar data together    In  supervised  learning,  the  training  usually  necessitates  splitting  the  available  data  into  training and evaluation data.    Supervised learning can be either classification or regression    When it comes to unsupervised learning, we mainly perform clustering and factor analysis    Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning algorithm where there exist an agent  which works based on a rewards and penalty basis. The agent will perform an action based  on its environment at that particular instance using the experience it already has.    In machine learning, we would always test a model to see how good of a job it can do on  new test data    We should also be careful about the problem of over-fitting which may arise    Mathematics is heavily involved in machine learning especially the use of vectors.    A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction, and we can transpose add or perform  inner product of vectors
