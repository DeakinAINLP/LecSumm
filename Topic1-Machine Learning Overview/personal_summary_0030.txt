intermediate experience, 2 years at uni and a year in highschool. Adding comments to your code is an excellent practice, and it can be especially helpful when working on more complex projects. By adding comments to your code, you can provide additional context and clarity to the logic you have written. This can make it easier for you to understand and debug your code later on, and it can also make it easier for other developers who may need to work on your code in the future.  How would you define machine learning? Do a bit more reading and come up with your own definition.  Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. It involves developing and training models that can identify patterns and relationships in large datasets, and then using those models to make predictions or decisions about new data. Using three main subjects; Tasks, Experience and Performance. In which tasks is defined by the action it needs to do, experience being the enhanced ability it receives out of performing those tasks over each episode, and the performance being how accurate is complete the tasks. Is the performance increases over each progressing task, the machine is send to have machine learnt  What do you think of these examples? Find another problem or application where machine learning could be used.  machine learning could be used is in fraud detection and prevention. Machine learning can be used to detect and prevent fraud by analyzing large datasets of financial transactions and identifying patterns that may be indicative of fraudulent activity, and then flag specific transactions and their whereabouts.  Do some research and provide a real-life example of machine learning that uses supervised learning.  Many virtual assistances, such as Siri and Alexa use machine learning to recognize and respond to voice commands from users. The models are trained on large datasets of audio recordings of people speaking, and use this information to recognize patterns in speech and interpret what the user is saying and understanding different accents and dialects based on a rang e of training data.  One real-life example of unsupervised learning is detecting data abnormalities, the detection of unusual data patterns or points that do not conform with the expected behavior. For example, in credit card and banking fraud detection, unsupervised learning models can be used to identify abnormal patterns in certain transactions that could indicate potential fraud. An unsupervised training model for the algorithm would trained on a dataset of credit card transactions that includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions, the algorithm would not be told which one is fraud and which is legitimate. The algorithm will then analyze patterns in the data which are atypical of a legitimate transaction, This could include large purchases, purchases in an unusual location or weird spending patterns.  This is an example of unsupervised learning because the algorithm is not given any pre-defined labels indicating which transactions are fraudulent and which are legitimate. Instead, it must identify hiccups in the data patterns on its own, making it unsupervised.  Other than applications in games, can you find an example where reinforcement learning is used in machine learning? Justify you answer.  Reinforcement learning can be used to develop a stock market buy and sell strategy that can learn from its past transactions to adapt to constantly changing market conditions. An RL algorithm can receive information about the stock market and then make decisions surrounding whether to nuy or sell stocks for a portfolio. The algorithm would receive a reward based upon the performance of the portfolio after the transaction. If the portfolio shows a high return, the algorithm will receive a positive reward and thus reinforce the behavior, but if the portfolio earns a low return, the algorithm receives a negative reward, thus signaling an undesired behavior . The RL algorithm learns from these rewards and penalties and updates its policy to improve the investment strategy. The policy is a set of rules or strategies that determine  Perform your own exploration of model evaluation and try to understand the differences between training, validation and test datasets. This additional video might be helpful.  During the training process, validation data is used to assess the model's performance and select the best hyperparameters. These hyperparameters, which determine the model's behavior, include settings like the learning rate, number of hidden layers, and activation function. By evaluating the model on the validation data, we can identify the hyperparameters that result in the best performance.  Once the model is trained and the hyperparameters are selected, test data is used to evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data. Test data is separated from the training and validation data to prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on the training and validation data but poorly on the test data. Proper division of the data into these subsets is essential to ensure that the model is capable of generalizing and performing well on new data. Therefore, the training, validation, and test data subsets each serve a critical purpose in evaluating and optimizing the performance of a machine learnin`g model.
