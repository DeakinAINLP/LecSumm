Summary: Through my study of Topic 1 I learnt by reading the content, watching the videos, taking notes and working through the activities. Evidence can be seen below. I have used python previously, I found the content a reminder of the common programming steps I’ve done in the past. I’ve usually used python through Jupyter Notebook, so this is currently set up on my computer. I’m not overly familiar with matrices so it was good to practice with them too.  Activity 1.2:  1.  Why do you think getting involved is an important part of study? This will help us to understand key learning by discussing with other.  How will you get involved? I’ll aim to be involved through online discussions. What barriers might you encounter to getting involved and what are your tips for overcoming these? Being an online student with personal commitments it’s likely that I will run into timing issues that could make it difficult to join online meetings.  2.  It looks like things have changed a little but still able to find it after some  exploration..  a.  b.  Activity 1.3:  1.  I have done some programming. Mostly with python, but some vba, SAS and SQL. I find see other worked examples the best way to understand how a function works.  Activity 1.4:  1.  Using information to predict future outcomes through computer programming to  iterate a best fit solution.  2.  ML is the art of using past records to predict future outcomes.  Activity 1.5:  1.  ML could be used in farming to help identify the needs of plant or animals. Then this  be used to automate the delivery of the needs.    Activity 1.6:  1.  I found watching the video reaffirmed my thoughts on ML.  Activity 1.7:  1.  I found a real life example of supervised learning to be SPAM detection in emails. This uses emails that are reported as SPAM for learning and then predicts if a new incoming email is SPAM or not.  2.  An example explanation was found on this site:  https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/11/30/machine-learning-spam- detection/#:~:text=Spam%20detection%20is%20a%20supervised,separate%20the%2 0two%20different%20categories.

This is considered unsupervised because it is clustering the data without using labelled data.  Activity 1.9: Another example of reinforcement learning would be a droid or robot that balances on a wheel. When positive feedback is provided due to how it reacts it reinforces better balance.  Activity 1.10: Perform your own exploration of model evaluation and try to understand the differences between training, validation and test datasets  Activity 1.13: A=[1 5 2 9], B=[5 8 2 9] and C=[3, 0, 2, 6] Distance(A,B) and Distance(A,C)  Distances found through various methods:
