The information covered in this topic was a basic introduction to machine learning and python. We briefly looked at some of the types of machine learning that we will look in depth into in the upcoming topics and some of the basics of the tools/libraries that we will need to use in python. Specifically, we looked at the basics of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, as well as the general basics of machine learning as a whole.  To complete this topics content we were required to research different aspects of machine learning and perform simple operations in python. We needed to understand the basics of data processing in python and demonstrate our understanding in this topics quiz. The main unit learning outcome that was covering in this topic was ULO4 as we mainly worked on improving our python skills so that we have the understanding to integrate basic python data processing with machine learning techniques in the future.  To complete the tasks for this topic I used the both the python documentation on w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/python/) for basic understanding of certain keywords, as well the documentation for NumPy (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/) because I have not used it previously.  I was fairly confident taking the quiz this topic because I have a fairly good understanding of the basic logic flow.
