 In topic 1 we learned about what is machine learning. Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to  learn  from  provided  data  and  make  predictions,  forecasts,  or  decisions  without  being explicitly  programmed.  It  involves  the  use  of  statistical  and  mathematical  techniques  to automatically discover patterns and relationships in data and make predictions or decisions based on this knowledge. Machine learning has become an indispensable tool in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, recommender  systems,  fraud  detection,  autonomous  vehicles.  and  many  others  Machine learning  is  classified  into  three  types:  supervised  learning,  unsupervised  learning,  and reinforcement learning.    Supervised  Learning:  In  supervised  learning,  the  algorithm  is  trained  using  labeled data,  or  information  that  has  already  been  marked  with  the  correct  response.  For fresh,  unlabeled  data,  the  objective  is  to  forecast  the  right  response.  Supervised learning algorithms can be applied to classification and regression issues.    Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning is a subset of machine learning in which the algorithm is taught on unlabeled data or data without any predefined labels. The objective is to find structure or patterns in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be used for clustering and dimensionality reduction problems.    Reinforcement learning: In reinforcement learning, an algorithm learns by interacting with the environment  and experiencing rewards or consequences  for its  decisions. Learn  an  ideal  policy  that  maximizes  the  cumulative  reward  over  time  in  order  to achieve  the  desired  result.  Robotics,  gaming,  and  control  systems  frequently  use reinforcement  learning  methods.  algorithms  can  be  used  for  clustering  and dimensionality reduction problems.  In machine learning, to get excellent results, model evaluation is a must. Model evaluation is a crucial component of machine learning because it enables us to evaluate how well a trained model performs on brand-new, unexplored data.   Accuracy, precision, and curves are often used metrics for model assessment. By splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets, the  cross-validation  approach  may  be  used  to  quantify  a  model's  performance  in  terms of generalization.  Then we delved into the mathematical aspects of machine learning such as Vectors  and  matrix  algebra  which  are  very  fundamental  to  the  understanding  of  machine learning. Vectors are mathematical objects that represent magnitude and direction and are often used to represent features in a dataset. Matrix algebra is utilized extensively in several ML  techniques,  including  principal  component  analysis  and  linear  regression,  to  execute operations on matrices, such as matrix multiplication, division, transpose, etc.  In the end, we learned more about the language Python. Python is a popular programming language for ML, due to its ease of use, flexibility, and a large ecosystem of libraries and tools. Libraries  such  as  NumPy,  Pandas,  and  Scikit-Learn  provide  powerful  functionality  for  data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
