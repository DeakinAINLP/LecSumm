Topic 1 Learning Summary Report  Name: Viola Birech  Assignment: Task 1.1P  Institution: Deakin University  Date: 22/03/2023        Topic 1 Learning Summary  Report and Reflections  In the first topic of the Machine Learning course, we were introduced to several key  concepts in the field of Machine Learning. The course started with a general overview of  real-world applications of Machine Learning and different types of Machine Learning.  Machine Learning was defined as a type of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to  learn by themselves without being explicitly programmed. The two main types of Machine  Learning are Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.  In Supervised Learning, the training data includes output information, i.e.,  labels/targets, and it is used to learn a function (model) from data to relate the inputs with  outputs. The target function is usually in the form of (x,y), where x represents a set of  attribute values, and y represents a discrete label (classification) or real valued number  (regression). In contrast, Unsupervised Learning is used to find the underlying structure of a  dataset that is unlabelled. Unsupervised Learning algorithms can be used for data  understanding and visualization, anomaly detection, information retrieval, and data  compression.  Next, we learned about different types of Machine Learning Algorithms, including  Unsupervised algorithms and Supervised algorithms. Unsupervised algorithms help find the  underlying structure of unlabelled datasets. One of the most common Unsupervised  algorithms is Clustering, which is the process of grouping similar points together to gain  insight into underlying patterns of different groups. Supervised algorithms, on the other hand,  learn a function (model) from data to relate the inputs with outputs. Two common examples  of Supervised algorithms are the Classification problem and the Regression problem.  In the context of Machine Learning, data instances are represented by a vector,  specifically by a feature vector. In this topic's course, you reviewed concepts from Linear  Algebra, such as Vectors and their operations, Matrix, and their operations. A data instance is  represented by a vector, and two simple vectors X and Y were demonstrated. Transpose,  addition, and inner product were the main vector operations highlighted.  The course also introduced the concept of Model Assessment and Selection. Model  evaluation is essential to determine if a model can do a perfect job of predicting the labels on  new and future test data. To evaluate a model, the training data is randomly split into a  training set and a test set. The training set is used to learn a model, and the model is evaluated  using the test set and a measurement, such as the accuracy of prediction. This process is  repeated for different random splits, and the results are averaged to improve accuracy. The  course also emphasized the importance of Model Selection, where the BEST model is  selected from the many knobs (parameters and hyper-parameters) that can be used to vary its  fitness to the data.  Finally, in the first topic of the Foundation of Machine Learning course, we reviewed  concepts from Linear Algebra, such as Vector and their operations, Matrix and their  operations. A data instance is represented by a vector, specifically by a feature vector. Two  simple vectors, X and Y, were demonstrated, and the main vector operations were  highlighted, including Transpose, Addition, and Inner product. This introduction to machine  learning was very informative and insightful. I believe that this sets a good foundation for me  and will greatly aid in my understanding of future units in this course.  Summary of Reading List  The first section of the machine learning course incorporated a range of resources for  utilization. Required readings consist of textbooks such as:    Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow    Python Machine Learning  Other additional resources are the various code libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and  scikit-learn which can be heavily utilized to learn and practicalize the lessons learnt. Research  papers and articles from journals are also crucial resources to enhance investigation on  current research areas in the field of machine learning. Online platforms like Kaggle and  DataCamp are also critical in utilization as supplementary materials for practice exercises and  tutorials.  Quiz 1.28 Score
