This topic was a high-level overview of machine learning and some of its real-world applications. The following points were covered:  Defining machine learning  What machine learning is, and how it is different from traditional  algorithms where rules are hard-coded. In machine learning, the input and the output are provided to the computer, and the computer must learn how to get from the input to the output on its own.  Applications of machine learning  Computer vision, Natural Language Processing, Healthcare, Robotics,  Agriculture, etc.  The steps involved in machine learning  Data acquisition and cleaning, splitting the data into training and  validation steps, selecting a model, training and evaluation the data, iterating over the training procedure, deploying the model.  Different kinds of machine learning  Supervised learning – labelled data (i.e., regression, image classification) Unsupervised learning – unlabelled data (i.e., clustering) Reinforcement learning – an agent interacts with its environment and is either rewarded or punished based on whether the action assisted or hindered the agent in meeting its goal.
