During this first topic, I have reviewed all the knowledge relating to machine learning such as the definition, different types of ML, their applications, and steps to build a model in ML: -  Machine learning: computers have “the ability to learn without being explicitly  programmed” (Samuel, 1959) or a computer program “to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improve with experience E” (Mitchell, 1997).  -  There are some types of ML such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning,  reinforcement learning, semi-supervised learning, evolutionary learning, ensemble learning, artificial neural network (ANN)…  -  Steps to build a ML model:  (7 steps of machine learning, Great Learning Team, 2023)  -  Application of ML: prediction, classification, voice or facial recognition, business  analytics, board games…  Later in the module we also reviewed the mathematical principles behind ML such as vector and matrices and how they can represent data features. We also conducted some basic matrix functions such as transpose, inverse, addition and multiplication.
