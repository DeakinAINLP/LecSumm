In this topic it covers the basic knowledge of the steps in machine learning. It includes five steps, data collection, clean and prepare data, train or build model, evaluate the model and improve /deploy. In terms of machine learning algorithm, thereâ€™s are two types of algorithms used to build a model based on data which are unsupervised and supervised learning. The goal of machine learning algorithm is to discover patterns in the data that can be used to make predications or decisions about the new data.  The  main  difference  between  unsupervised  and  supervised  learning  is  that  supervised learning involves training model on labelled data with target values, however unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabelled data to discover patterns and relationships with the data.  Moreover, it covers the knowledge of linear algebra. Vectors and matrix are used to represent data and model parameters in machine learning. Vectors are arrays of numbers, while matrix are arrays of vectors.
