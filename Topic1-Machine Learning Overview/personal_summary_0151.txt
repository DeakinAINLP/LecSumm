 Throughout this topic's content, I have learned about the deﬁniDon of machine learning, its diﬀerent types, and how data is represented in machine learning algorithms. AddiDonally, I have been introduced to Python programming, which is a popular language used for machine learning. I went through some examples of machine learning applicaDons in real world, such as roboDcs, board games, voice recogniDon. Furthermore, I have gained an understanding of the machine learning process, which involves data collecDon, cleaning, model training, and evaluaDon. Overall, this topic's content has provided me with a foundaDonal understanding of machine learning and its pracDcal applicaDons. I have also gained some hands-on experience with Python programming, which is a crucial tool for implemenDng machine learning algorithms.
