This topic we were introduced to various concepts and terminologies.  Machine Learning –  A set of tools to derive meaning from data. Has the ability to adapt and learn over time without the use of explicit instructions. This can be broken down into 3 stages: data manipulation, analytics, evaluation/ visualisation. Has many real-life applications including robotics, computer vision, stock market predictions, etc.  Supervised learning –  A form of machine learning where the dataset is labelled. By using training data with pre-established relationships, we can a model can classify future inputs.  Unsupervised learning –  A form of machine learning where the dataset is not labelled. More efficient for larger datasets.  Clustering –  An unsupervised learning approach where data points are grouped into clusters with similar features.  Reinforcement learning –  A form of machine learning where the agent learns from iterative interactions. Each decision is evaluated based on its effectiveness in reaching the goal.  This topic’s content was an effective introduction into the various forms machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement) and their applications/distinctions. It was also a good introduction into how datapoints are mathematically represented in machine learning (vectors, matrices). Lastly, I was able to refresh my Python skills which will be important once we start delving into the coding aspect of machine learning.
