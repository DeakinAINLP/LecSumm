 During the first topic we mainly focused on getting back into the language of python and to expect in the course. Some main topics that we learnt were:  -  What is an algorithm ( set of instructions) -  What libraries will we be using, NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib -  What is machine learning? Machine learning is a type of Ai which uses data and algorithms  to imitate the way humans learn  -  How machine learning can be used in the real world. It can be applied in robotics, board  -  games, voice recognition, and stock market predictions. The three steps of machine learning would be data manipulation, analytics and evaluation and visualisation  -  Reinforcement learning method is type machine algorithm. -  A vector has both length and direction, it can be used to so relations between data objects with in ML. the three main operations in vectors include Transpose, Add and Inner product.
