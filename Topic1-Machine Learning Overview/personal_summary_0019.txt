Within the first topic of this unit, I am able to broadly gain an understanding on the outline of machine learning, what it is, its usage within the real-world and can also understand their sub types such as supervised and unsupervised learning.  I am also able to understand the basis of coding within python, through the completion of the problem-solving tasks provided within this module, from creating dictionaries, functions and matrices to reading data from an external csv file and converting it to a matrix. Through this, and in addition to the linear algebra content provided within this unit and the lecture, I am able to gain a broad understanding of linear algebra and how it would apply towards python programming and machine learning.  Overall, I am able to understand the concepts of machine learning and can implement python programming.
