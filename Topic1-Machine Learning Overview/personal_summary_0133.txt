We have been introduced to real world applications, machine learning steps, machine learning concepts (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning), data model evaluation, the relationship between machine learning and mathematics, and basic Python usage in the first topic. We also worked on some mathematical concepts (vectors and matrixes).  This topic’s content was easy as it started with an introduction to machine learning concepts and continued with a reminder of my prior mathematics knowledge. I also had programming experience and I have been using Python for more than five years. The most interesting part of this topic was the “Too much data (1.4 Defining Machine Learning)” section which I encountered a video about the idea. The speaker was talking about the developers of Microsoft Word and how did they solve the grammar correction problem with less computing power and less time consumption on development by using big data and machine learning.  Here is my quiz score for the first topic.
