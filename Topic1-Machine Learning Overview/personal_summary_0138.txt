  In  the  topic  one  online  class,  we  mainly  learnt  definitions  of  machine  learning,  real-world  applications  of  machine  learning,  steps  in  machine  learning,  overview  of  types  of  machine  learning  algorithm  including  supervised  learning,  supervised  learning  and  reinforcement  learning and model assessment and selection.  During the second half of the class, we revised our knowledge of some linear algebra theories,  including vectors and basic vector operations and matrices and matrix operations. We discussed  about three main operations in vectors including vector transpose, vector addition and inner  product. We also learnt how to calculate magnitude of a vector and distance between vectors.  Under matrix algebra, we learnt types of matrices, transpose of a matrix, basic operations in  matrices  including  matrix  addition,  subtraction,  multiplication  and  division.  Under  matrix  multiplication  we  reviewed  scalar  multiplication,  element-wise  matrix  multiplication  and  matrix to matrix multiplication. We also learnt how to get the inverse of a matrix and some  special matrices.  In the workshop one, we acquired the knowledge of basic python programming concepts and  coding skills. We got the hands-on experience of python variable types and declaration, python  lists, tuples and dictionaries, branching and iterations (loops) and how to define and work with  python functions.
