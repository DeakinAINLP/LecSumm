 It appeared that there was a significantly large amount of material to work through this topic.  After covering some introductory information and housekeeping, some topics were introduced including: a definition of machine learning as a subset of artificial intelligence, different types of learning that can take place with machine learning, the application of mathematics to machine learning, and some introductory material for python.  The only new material for myself this topic was some of the machine learning information regarding the different learning types and how and when they are used.
