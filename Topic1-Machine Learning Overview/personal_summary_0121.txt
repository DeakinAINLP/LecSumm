1. Summarize the main points that is covered in this topic.  a)  I have learned about the general definition of machine learning as a computer first uses some data and learns a task with respect to some performance measure, and it can perform the task again and again with new data and produce new outputs.  b) There are three types of machine learning, including supervised learning,  unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.  c) Supervised learning learns a function from data to relate inputs to known outputs, while unsupervised learning looks for a underlying structure of a dataset that is not labeled.  d) Machine learning can be split into several steps:  data manipulation such as data acquisition, data storage, and data cleaning i. ii. data analytics such as looking for relationships, exploratory data analysis, and  predictive machine learning  iii. model evaluation, refinement and visualization (train-test split, overfitting)  e) vectors: a series of related numbers  i.  vector operations and matrices operations
