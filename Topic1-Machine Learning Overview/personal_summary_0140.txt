A basic introduction to Machine Learning was covered this topic. I learned the definition of machine learning and its types from the lecture. Also learned about the types of machine learning which the following: Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, and Reinforcement learning. A major difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is the data used for training. Models are trained using labeled data for supervised learning, whereas unsupervised models are trained using unlabeled data. Moreover, supervised learning is classified into two categories classification and regression. At the same time, unsupervised learning is classified as clustering and association analysis. Also know about real-world machine learning applications such as robotics, gaming, etc. Python programming is important to develop a machine learning model so, I learned the basics of python programming such as types of variables, loops, functions, etc also explored some useful libraries such as numpy, pandas, etc. Along with Python, Mathâ€™s also important for machine learning models so revised some topics of machine learning such as vectors, matrices, etc.
