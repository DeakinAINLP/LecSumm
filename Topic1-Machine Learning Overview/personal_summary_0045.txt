LESSON REVIEW: I’ve been a software developer for 20+ years and have used and continue to use many of the methods that are now considered “machine learning” or “artificial intelligence”. My current position is Systems Architect for ML & AI at Certified Collectables Group and I design and implement end to end ML/AI solutions to automate the identification, classification & grading of collectables. So this topic I learnt nothing new.  I did however discover that many of the quiz questions are poorly worded and/or just plain wrong. Here is a screen shot of 2 question in quiz 1 that have incorrect answers:  The answer that is considered correct for question 8 is “It displays output on the screen”. The print function does absolutely nothing without input. The source documentation clearly states that it prints the input objects: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print  The answer that is considered correct for question 10 is (b). But (b) is the answer to the question “How can you print every 2nd character OF EACH WORD IN THE STRING STR”.  The answer to the question about printing numbers between 0 and 2000 is also clearly incorrect.  SUMMARY OF THE MAIN POINTS FOR TOPIC 1 LEARNING:  This topics learning covered the absolute bare minimum pre-requisite knowledge and skills I’d expect a student to already have even to take this class.   Basic software concepts, variables, functions, branching, loops etc. Basic python, numpy,  pandas etc.   Basic mathematics: vectors and matrices.  A few examples of some broad categories of ML methods i.e. supervised, unsupervised,  reinforcement learning etc.   A simplified description of the steps involved in an idealised ML process i.e. Data   manipulation, Analytics, Model Evaluation, Model Selection. Some examples of areas where ML is used i.e. games, robotics, and missing some of the most common and successful applications i.e. biotech, consumer behaviour, fraud detection and of course, human surveillance.
