In topic 1, we were provided with an overview of Machine Learning, including its definition and applications in real-world scenarios as well as touching on the importance of mathematics in Machine Learning.  Machine Learning is a field of study that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so and is a set of tools that can extract meaning from data. If a machine can process the information given to it and respond to the input in order to produce results that, over time, develop more and more like the desired end, then it can be considered to be learning. We have so much data at our disposal that it is impossible to make sense of it all. In order to deliver usable results, automated systems (ML) will learn from the data we provide them with and, more significantly, adapt to changes in the data. Some real-world applications of Machine Learning include robotics, computer vision, board games, voice recognition, as well as digit recognition.  There are three main stages to Machine Learning, Data Manipulation, Analytics, as well as Evaluation and Visualization. The first step of Data Manipulation is sampling the data and once the data is stored, we clean the data by removing any redundant or missing values. The next stage of Machine Learning involves finding relationships and correlations in the data we prepared. Another part of the Analytics stage is Exploratory Data Analysis, which is a method for analysing datasets to highlight their key traits or attributes. Predictive Machine Learning, the final step in Analytics, uses various statistical techniques like predictive modelling in order to develop classifiers or intelligent systems for decision-making.  Machine Learning can be divided into supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The majority of practical Machine Learning uses supervised learning, which involves training the algorithm by using labelled data to allow it to learn to make predictions on new and unlabelled data. On the other hand, unsupervised learning involves finding patterns and relationships in unlabelled data. A few examples of unsupervised Machine Learning would be, information retrieval, data compression, anomaly detection, and data understanding and visualization.  Another type of Machine Learning is reinforcement learning, in this type of learning the algorithm learns how to behave by acting and then being judged based on that behaviour, rather than being told what is correct and what is not. Machine Learning models need to be evaluated to determine their ability to predict the labels of new and future data. The evaluation process involves randomly dividing the examples into training and test datasets, using the training dataset to learn a model and using the test dataset to evaluate the model, and keep repeating this for different random splits to get an average result of predictions.        Mathematics is the foundation of Machine Learning, and understanding mathematical concepts is crucial for producing excellent results. Vectors and matrices are fundamental elements of both linear algebra and Machine Learning algorithms. The vector space model is a representation of a collection of documents as vectors. Overall, Machine Learning is an effective tool for deciphering complex data and drawing out insightful conclusions from it.
