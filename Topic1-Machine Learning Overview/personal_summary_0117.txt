This topic introduces and emphasize some important points, which are:    What is machine learning   The importance of machine learning and its application   Types of machine learning   After training an ML model, how to evaluate it. This page also talks about one potential  problem called over-fitting.    The kownledge about vector, matrix and how to manipulate it.   The basic data type in python   The flow control statements in python   Functions in python   How to use NumPy to execute linear algebra operations on structured data fitted in  matrix  In the learning process of the content of the first topic, I viewed “What is machine learning?”(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXHM_i-fgGo) explaining what is supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning and reinforcement learning. It said that supervised machine learning has training sets which involve labels but unsupervised machine learning and reinforcement learning don’t. reinforce learning grade the outcome and then let the result be trickled back down to learn the strategy. This video also explains what the neural network is. I also use ChatGPT to troubleshoot my python code snippet.  I gained a lot of useful knowledge. For example, I learned what the reinforcement learning and what is problem of over-fitting. Besides, through coding, I’m more familiar with the usage of numpy and know how to do calculation within matrics.  The following screenshot proves that I passed the quiz:
