 Theory:  Machine Learning is defined as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so. The three steps of machine learning include:    Data Manipulation   Analytics   Evaluation and Visualization  There are three types of Learning:  Supervised Learning:    Datasets have built-in relationship   Requires dividing the data into training set and testing set   Two types of the learning:  o  Classification problem: The data is divided according to the trained algorithm o  Regression problem: Relationship between response variables and one or more  predictor variables are examined by the algorithm.  Unsupervised Learning:  o  Datasets are completely unlabeled o  Two approaches to the learning:  o  Clustering: The goal is for the model to find relative similarities in the data points. o  Factor Analysis  Reinforcement Learning:  o  An agent learns to behave in an environment by interaction with it through actions.  Reflect:  In this topic I learned about the concept of machine learning through articles on DeakinSync. At the end of topic I understand what machine learning, its popular applications, the different types of machine learning and their methods. I also refreshed my mathâ€™s knowledge involving matrices and matrix operations, vectors operations and probability.  For programming I consulted the articles, W3schools website and the Jupyter Notebooks. Learned the basics of python as well as performing matrix operations and evaluating data.
