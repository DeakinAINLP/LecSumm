In this topic on unit learning we understand and learn about the main and fundamental concept of machine learning . We learning about supervised and unsupervised machine learning. More over we learn about the coding skills required to implement machine learning. We learn about basic of python and libraries that python language use to work for machine learning code. We also learn that how machine learning is different from other programming languages. we came to know that using machine learning methods like SVM and Deep learning we can hit the accuracy rate of up-to 99%. We also learn about three major steps of machine learning which are data manipulation, analytics and evaluation and visualisation. Other than that we learn about specific areas supervised and unsupervised machine learnings are used in. We learn to code is machine learning using python. which includes all the basic programming, loops, conditions, arrays, list and matrix. We have done task activities in these areas as-well for this topic.
