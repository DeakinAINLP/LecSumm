In  this  topic  I  learned  about  what  is  machine  learning,  what  is  use  of  machine  learning,  steps  of machine learning, and type of machine learning.  Machine  learning  means  user  provide  a  data  to  machine  and  learn  the  pattern  of  data  by  using statistically and different algorithm , and give us some useful information and this information can be used for look up the relationship between different types of data and predict the outcomes of future.  There are three steps for machine learning, these are data manipulation, analytics, and evaluation an visualisation.  I learned there are three types of machines learning i.e., supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, and reinforcement machine learning.  Also, I learned the need of best model for the machine learning i.e., model evaluation and selection of model based on the problem.  I got the knowledge of vectors and their operations and how to calculate the distance between two vectors to find the similarity between two vectors.
