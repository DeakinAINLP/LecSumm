Topic 1 was all about what is machine learning and a reintroduction to python  What is machine learning? “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed,” (Samuel 1959)  “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E,” (Mitchell 1997, p. 2)  Machine learning is performance improving with experience. Experience is the data we provide to the machine. Too much data for humans easier to train a computer.  Activity 1.4: How would you define machine learning? Broadly defined as giving a machine the capability to imitate intelligent human behaviour. Then use that imitation to perform complex tasks in a way like how a human would. For example, ChatGPT and predictive text.  Activity 1.5: What do you think of these examples? Find another problem or application where machine learning could be used.  Image generation/AI Art (regardless of all the ethics questions it raises) like stable diffusion.  Step 1: Data manipulation 1.1 Data Acquisition. Sampling information that illustrates real world condifitions. 1.2 Data storage. 1.3 Data clearning. Real world data is noisy and often has redundancy and missing values. Step 2: Analytics Finding relationships and correlations in the prepared data in order to design an accurate model Step 3: Evaluation and Visualisation  What is supervised learning?  learning a function (otherwise known as a model) from data to relate inputs to known outputs.  Activity 1.8: Do some research and provide a real-life example from machine learning that uses unsupervised learning. Justify why it classifies as unsupervised learning and not supervised learning. Customer Segregation, understanding your different customer groups in which to predict what marketing might work best.
