Question 1   We covered ,where ML can be used in the real world and what models of ML can be used after analysing the data.   We also briefed on types of machine  learning  such as unsupervised, supervised and reinforcement learning and also covered machine learning algorithms such as clustering and dimensionally reduction, classification and regression.   Also covered when to use unsupervised and supervised learning.   Additionally, we also revised on matrix and operation on matrix. Question 2 The  content  written  in  the  report  and  the  code  was  referred  from  the  Deakin  lecture classes and materials.  Additionally I also used w3schools.com for the reference of the python code and also stackflow.com to learn about the libraries and code structure. Question 3 This topic I have gained knowledge on ML models and python libraries and also matrix operation  and  operation  on  matrix.  Also  covered  how  and  when  different  type  of algorithms are used in ML based on the data provided.
