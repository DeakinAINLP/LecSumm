   Topics Covered This Topic Machine Learning Steps The steps involved in Machine Learning (ML) are:    Data  Manipulation:  This  involves  data  acquisition,  converting  data  into  digital  numeric  values, and data cleaning to remove noise, redundancy, and missing values.    Analytics:  This  step  includes  finding  relationships  and  correlations  in  the  prepared  data, exploratory  data  analysis  to  summarise  main  characteristics,  and  predictive  machine learning to build classifiers or intelligent decision-making systems.    Evaluation  and  Visualisation:  The  final  step  involves  assessing  the  performance  of  the intelligent system or model, refining it if necessary, and iterating through the process. The unit focuses primarily on the Analytics step, with some Data Manipulation aspects involved in building a model.  Supervised Learning Overview Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained using labelled data. The model learns to make predictions based on input-output pairs, which are used to minimise errors and improve  accuracy.  Common  supervised  learning  algorithms  include  linear  regression,  logistic regression, and support vector machines.  Unsupervised Learning Overview Unsupervised learning involves training a model without labelled data. The goal is to identify patterns, relationships,  or  structures  within  the  data.  Common  unsupervised  learning  methods  include clustering  (e.g.,  K-means),  dimensionality  reduction  (e.g.,  PCA),  and  association  rule  learning  (e.g., Apriori).  Reinforcement Learning Overview Reinforcement  learning  is  a  type  of machine  learning  where  an  agent  learns  to  make  decisions  by interacting  with  an  environment.  The  agent  receives  feedback  through  rewards  or  penalties  and optimises its actions to maximise cumulative rewards. Reinforcement learning is commonly used in robotics, game-playing, and autonomous systems.  Model Evaluation and Selection Model evaluation and selection involve assessing the performance of various machine learning models and choosing the best one for a given task. Techniques for model evaluation include cross-validation, confusion  matrix,  and  performance  metrics  like  accuracy,  precision,  recall,  and  F1-score.  Model selection  techniques,  such  as  grid  search  and  random  search,  help  find  the  best  combination  of hyperparameters.  Mathematics in Machine Learning Mathematics is critical in machine learning, providing the foundation for algorithms and models. Key mathematical concepts include linear algebra, probability, statistics, calculus, and optimisation.  Vectors and its operations Vectors  are  fundamental  elements  in  linear  algebra,  representing  points  or  directions  in  a multidimensional  space.  Common  vector  operations include  addition,  subtraction,  scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product.        Distances between Vectors Distances  between vectors  measure  the  similarity  or  dissimilarity  of  data  points  in  a  vector  space. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and cosine similarity.  Matrix Algebra Matrix algebra is a branch of linear algebra that manipulates matrices - rectangular arrays of numbers. Key matrix operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion. Matrix algebra is essential  in  machine  learning  for  solving  systems  of  linear  equations,  transforming  data,  and representing linear transformations.  Additional Content Summary  1.

These topics provide insights into various learning paradigms and the appropriate algorithms for tackling problems.  Model evaluation and selection are crucial for assessing the performance of machine learning models and ensuring the chosen model is well-suited for a particular task. A strong understanding of these topics helps to avoid overfitting, underfitting, and other common pitfalls in machine learning.  A strong foundation in mathematics, particularly linear algebra, probability, statistics, calculus, and optimisation, is essential for understanding the theoretical aspects of machine learning algorithms. This knowledge helps in selecting appropriate models and optimising their performance.  Vectors,  vector  operations,  distances  between  vectors,  and  matrix  algebra  are  key  linear  algebra concepts extensively used in machine learning. They are essential for representing and manipulating data,  computing  similarities,  and  performing  transformations.  A  thorough  understanding  of  these topics ensures the effective application of machine-learning techniques to real-world problems.
