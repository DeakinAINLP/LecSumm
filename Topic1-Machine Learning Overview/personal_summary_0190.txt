Why machine learning:  -  We are unable to make sense of the information because there is so much of it. It seems as though you must select the ideal automobile for each Deakin student. To make informed selections, it would be quite difficult to know what each person wants and needs while also including all the information about the various vehicle types.  - -  In order to deliver usable results, automated systems (ML) will learn from the data we provide them with and, more significantly, adapt to changes in the data.  Machine Learning steps:  -  Data Manipulation: Data acquisition is the initial stage in data manipulation. Data collection is  the procedure of taking samples of information to represent actual physical circumstances using a predetermined measurement.  -  Analytics is the second critical step in machine learning. In order to create an accurate model  based on the provided data, analytics primarily entails identifying relationships and correlations in the prepared data.  -  Analytics ultimately produces an intelligent model or system. We must assess the system's  performance as the final stage of ML design. "Did I pick the right car?" you ask.  Supervised Learning overview:  A machine learning technique called supervised learning teaches an algorithm to predict or decide based on labelled training data. In this method, a dataset made up of input data and corresponding output labels or target values is given. The algorithm gains knowledge from this labelled data by seeing trends and connections between the input and output variables, allowing it to extrapolate from it and make assumptions about previously unknown data. The algorithm modifies its internal parameters or model during training to reduce the difference between its projected outputs and the actual labels. In supervised learning, the objective is to build a model that can correctly predict the output or label for novel, unforeseen input data.  Unsupervised Learning:  A fascinating feature of machine learning called reinforcement learning involves an agent exploring its surroundings with a voracious appetite for knowledge. It explores unfamiliar area by trial and error, looking for acts that result in rewarding rewards or, occasionally, biting consequences. The agent's ultimate goal is to learn how to make the best decisions possible, balancing states and actions into a mesmerising symphony. This fascinating adventure is an exciting combination of discovery and adaptation. The agent adjusts its strategy with each mission, motivated by the desire to earn more prizes. Reinforcement learning has won over domains in robotics, gaming, autonomous systems, and countless other areas, dazzling the future with its kaleidoscope of possibilities.
