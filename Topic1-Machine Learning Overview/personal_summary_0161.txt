 The  first  topic  primarily  covered  the  structure  of  the  unit  and  provided  a  course overview. It further covered the following preliminary topics:  1.  Introduction to Machine Learning (ML): The first class introduced us to what machine  learning  is  and  the  steps  involved  in  ML  such  as  data  collection, cleaning, training models, evaluating models and improving or deploying them. It  also  taught  us  the  types  of  ML,  namely  –  supervised,  unsupervised  and reinforcement.  2.  Model  Assessment  and  Adjustment:  It  taught  us  how  to  find  out  the  best suited model and come up with a justification on why that is the best one. 3.  Vectors:  It  talked  about  representation  of  data  points  via  vectors.  We considered the example of a blood sample and how the data of each patient can be represented as rows and columns. It also spoke about vector operations such  as  Transpose,  Addition  and  Inner  Product.  Lastly,  it  discussed  how  to calculate  the  magnitude  of  length  of  a  vector  and  distance  between  vectors using Euclidean distance, cosine distance, etc.  4.  Matrix: It introduced us to the concept of matrices and how they can be created and  manipulated  using  numpy  library.  We  learnt  about  the  various  types, namely  –  Square  matrix,  rectangular  matrix,  diagonal  matrix,  identity  matrix, transpose matrix and symmetric matrix.  5.  Matrix Operations: We learnt about how we can perform various operations on matrices such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We also learnt about the concept of the inverse matrix.  The above learnings coupled with the lecture slides and learning resources on the unit site gave a comprehensive understanding of the foundations of machine learning and prepared us for the unit ahead. I also had the opportunity to test my knowledge using the  quiz  and  activity  questions,  whose  results  have  been  attached  along  with  this submission:
