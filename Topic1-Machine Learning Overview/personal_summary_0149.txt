Summary of main points:  We have learnt about real world applications which involves machine learning concepts like voice recognition, robotics, computer vision etc Usage of python 3 for vectors, matrices etc Learnt about machine learning steps which include data manipulation, data anylytics, data evaluation and visualiziation Classification problem is a learning problem with two classes, decision boundaries are a hyper-surface that partitions data space into two sets, each of these sets represent one of the classes Regression is to examine the relationship between response variables and one or more predictor variables Some data is un supervised and for that we use clustering which is a technique to find relative similarities between data points Reinforcement learning is an important technique in Machine learning in which algorithm learns how to behave in an environment by learning and behaving from environment just like humans We have learnt about mathematical operations like symmetric matrices, transpose of matrix, matrix multiplication, identity matrix etc Learnt about basics of python coding like printing strings, making random values matrices, usage of lists, dictionaries, tuples, branching and trees, loops etc  10)  We have also learnt about python functions and how to import python modules and  packages like usage of numpy package  Summary of Reading List: Machine learning is an vital element of the growing discipline of information science. Through the use of statistical techniques, algorithms are skilled to make classifications or predictions, and to find key insights in information mining projects. These insights subsequently force decision making inside packages and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. As large statistics keeps to amplify and grow, the market call for for records scientists will growth. They could be required to help identify the most relevant commercial enterprise questions and the information to answer them. Classical machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm learns to become more accurate in its predictions. There are four basic approaches:supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi- supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The type of algorithm data scientists choose to use depends on what type of data they want to predict Some Usage of machine learning are as follows:    Healthcare and lifestyles sciences businesses teach crash carts to apprehend whilst someone    is going to have a heart attack earlier than it takes place Financial offerings and coverage organizations permit rapid approval of loan applications, credit playing cards, root out fraud, and guard towards cyberattacks.    Gaming and leisure businesses generate real-time leaderboards and interactions, flag  objectionable text and interactions, as well as hold humans engaged with advocated next sports. Logistics and transportation businesses use device mastering to optimize routes, prevent fraud, and decrease gasoline prices
