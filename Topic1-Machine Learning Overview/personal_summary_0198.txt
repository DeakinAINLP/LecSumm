Summary The main point of this ﬁrst topic has been to understand the most basic knowledge required for this unit such as how to write scripts in python and how matrices work.  When it comes to python programming we went over the concepts of variables of diﬀerent types, various forms of arrays such as lists and dictionaries. Also covered was functions, loops and logic as well as using basic numpy functions.  A second equally important part of this topic was covering the basics of array operations so that we can understand how they work when using numpy functions. We learnt how to multiply, add and transpose matrices.  Reﬂection The things studied in this topic are not the most complex things that will be studied in this unit but they are all fundamental parts of this unit. As I have some experience with matrices and a decent amount of experience with python none of the topics where very hard as I have done all of it multiple times before.  Despite having done it before a refresher is always useful to have as it helps to get in the right mindset of using python and matrices again.
