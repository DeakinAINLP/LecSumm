 Summary of main points Machine Learning is the ability for a computer to learn without being explicitly programmed.  Some examples of real-world applica<ons of machine learning are: -  Algorithms that play strategy board games such as AlphaGo. -  Voice recogni<on i.e., Google, Alexa, Siri – being able to recognize millions of diﬀerent voices. -  Robots that ﬁnd out the right <me to do ac<ons based on past experiences.  To reach the end goal of learning to make decisions machine learning starts by acquiring and manipula<ng data so it can be analysed, then evalua<ng and reﬁning the result.  Supervised learning is learning a func<on from data to relate inputs to known outputs. Unsupervised learning is where there are no labels on the data.
