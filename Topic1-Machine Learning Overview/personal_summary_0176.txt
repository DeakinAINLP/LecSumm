Summary    We covered an overview of machine learning, the different ‘disciplines’ of machine learning  (supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning)    We highlighted some of the basic linear algebra maths required as a foundation for machine  learning    We discussed some maths to determine the distance between data points. This can be useful when determining whether a new data point belongs to a cluster in unsupervised learning or whether it falls above or below a function line in supervised learning. In the workshop we covered setting up python, including some of it’s popular libraries such as numpy and pandas.      We then covered some matrix manipulation possible with these libraries in python.  Reading List and Knowledge Reflection  In order to strengthen my understanding of these topics I sought out additional resources including:    The khan academy – some really helpful videos in understanding the maths surrounding  these topics    3Blue1Brown videos – despite having covered some of this linear algebra before including eigenvectors and eigenvalues I always just thought of them as tools for finding information about matrices but looking at them as concepts was eye opening   PatrickJMT YouTube videos – again more information on linear algebra   Machine Learning Guide Podcast – not as directly associated with this module but I’ve found  Tyler Renelle’s audio podcast to be very interesting and helpful for understanding the overarching concepts of ML. I will continue to listen to this podcast while driving to work I am new to Python so I have also been taking a course on Mammoth Interactive on the basics of python and that has been very helpful too.
