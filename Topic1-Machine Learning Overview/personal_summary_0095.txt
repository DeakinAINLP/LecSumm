This topic provided a high-level overview of machine learning and its applications. The steps involved in machine learning were explained and then a more detailed explanation of the types of machine learning was provided. Supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning algorithms were covered.  The second part of the topic was focused on algebra and the core mathematics that are utilized in Machine learning. We explored vectors and matrices and the key operations that can be performed on those.  The third part of the topic focused on the Python programming language, its core data types and operations including python libraries
