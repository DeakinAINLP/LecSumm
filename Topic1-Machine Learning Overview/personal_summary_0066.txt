In topic 1, we learned about the different types of ML algorithm which are:  - Unsupervised Learning - Supervised Learning - Reinforcement Learning  Then we learnt about the different models (based on the problems they face) under them such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, classification and regression. Which model to choose when and the kind of adjustments ( i.e splitting the data) to make in order to make the task easier. We then revised Linear Algebra and learnt about how to use that in ML.
