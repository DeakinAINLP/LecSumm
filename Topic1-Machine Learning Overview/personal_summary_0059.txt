  This is the introdcution topic where we got to know the basic steps before advancing to the  main parts of the machine learning techniques.    We start of with first learning the machine learning types such as Supervised and Unsupervised  machine learning techniques.    We later move to setting up the python to work on it and learning the computations related to  matrix and basic arithmetic operations exceuted in Python  EXPLANATION FOR PROBLEM SOLVINGS:    We first define a String whose value is equal to Pythoin is Fun and we write Python Code that  prints every third character    We create 3 list variables as suggested and add random values inside it by using the function  np.random.randn    We create dictionary variable with 3 keys and insert the list created in the previous question  inside this dictionary variable.    We use the If function to provide a conditional statement where the output is dependent on the  value of the energy variable.    We use the conditional for loop statement to print numbers divisible by 5 between 0 to 2000.   We can break the loop by adding a conditional statement within the loop.   We create a function with variables X and Y and then add separate functions for each and call  the function with the value (4,7).    We create a 3x3 identity matrix and then multiply it with a random matrix of size 3x4 which is  created using the random function.    We create a 5x2 matrix and initialise it with random values and then transpose the matrix into a  2x5 matrix.    We read the file data.csv using pd.read(“data.csv”). we follow it up by finding the number of  instances and number of variables. We also find the mean of the second variable and mean of the origianal variable
