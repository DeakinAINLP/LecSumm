This topic I learned basic concepts of Machine Learning. As it Is a very interesting technology where we can make machine learn itself and extract required executions rather than programming explicitly.  These days Machine Learning are used in various fields such as:-  ➢  Business Analytics ➢  Facial or Number Plate Recognisation ➢  Stock Market Predictions ➢  Healthcare Analytics  Mainly Machine Learning involves three steps which are Data Manipulation, Analytics and Evaluation and Visualisation.  So in Data Manipulation we prepare data so that further operations can be performed on it. In Machine learning we use ample of data which is raw data which contains errors, noise, empty blocks, unusable blocks. So to make it more machine friendly we do some operations on it to make it clean.  Second step is Analytics,  in this step mostly relations between the data is found in order to develop a well suited model. Moreover, summerisation of data is done to find out the main characteristics of data.  Last step is Evaluation and Visualisation, where we evaluate the performance of the system.  Moreover, I learned how to perform various operation on matrices for example multiplication, transpose etc. Further more operations like addition, subtraction and division.  I also learned how to code function where we use a “def” keyword to define a  function. Also learned about the basic data types in Python and how to declare them. Iterations plays a very major role when we are dealing with huge amount of data. Slicing is a very interesting concept in python where we can break the strings or integers on required jumps.
