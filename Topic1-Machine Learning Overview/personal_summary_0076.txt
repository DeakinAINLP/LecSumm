 Main points of this module:    Machine Learning (ML) is way in which we give computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. The reason for creating these automated systems is to deal with large volumes of data.    Machine Learning steps include Data Manipulation (preparing collected data), Analytics  (finding correlations), Evaluation/Visualisation (decision-making based on presentations of data).    Supervised learning is trained, we first give the algorithm known relationships in the data,  (classification and regression problems).    Unsupervised learning is not trained, no additional information is given about the data  (clustering, factor analysis).    Reinforcement learning is when the machine interacts with its environment and receives feedback (either positive or negative) in regard to reaching the given goal, and learns for itself which actions are advantageous/disadvantageous.    Model evaluation is critical for determining the accuracy of our predictions of future data.   Machine Learning is built upon mathematics. Some key areas include vectors, matrices, and  probability.
