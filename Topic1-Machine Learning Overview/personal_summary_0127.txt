The first topic of the unit was just an introduction to what we would be learning about and doing throughout the trimester. We briefly touched on what machine learning is, and the different types of machine learning. As algorithms are a huge part of machine learning, the topic focused on the basics of algorithms, writing in python, and some matrix manipulation that are useful as we continue to learn more about machine learning and its processes. I didn’t really learn all that much in the first topic as it was more of a refresher topic, and so I don’t have any resources that I looked to, to further understand and aid my learning during the topic.
