In topic one, what I have learned is summarised here –  The first topic started with introducing the unit and telling about the unit and how we can get maximum knowledge and understanding of the unit. The conversation with the teacher, and tutor, and by attending workshops, contributing to your own or other’s learning through sharing of our knowledge and understanding of the unit with others. By following the 3c’s Rule we can understand and learn far better, the 3c’s are we need to be curious, constructive, and compassionate. After getting the introduction we started to know about our unit which will use mathematical concepts like matrices, vectors, and probability. We will be using python 3 for preparing programs and learning machine learning.  Then I came to know about data camp which provides an interactive way to learn python online by gaining xp for each learning. I learned the basics of python from data camp. Furthermore, we also learn about what’s an algorithm and how it works. In short, we can say the algorithm can be defined by the set of instructions.  Then we come across the definition of Machine learning provided by various famous people. It is hard to understand with one definition but the data which we are creating every day and if it is getting collected anywhere in the world to analyze that data and use that data we need machine learning to use that data effectively and to get insights of it, also it provides a way to a machine by which it can learn like we human learn from our mistakes. That makes machine learning more attractive to me. Machine learning is a process that involves teaching computers how to perform various tasks using specialized computer algorithms. Through this approach, the computer can learn and adapt to new information without explicit programming, similar to how humans learn and develop their skills over time. After that, we came across the fields which use machine learning now, from games to voice and digital recognition.  Then I came across the steps of machine learning, The First step is called data manipulation, which comprises acquiring data and cleaning it up. The subsequent stage is analytics, which entails identifying patterns and links in the processed data and utilizing predictive modeling to create an intelligent system that can help in decision-making. The ultimate phase is the evaluation and visualization of the model's effectiveness, and if it falls short, refining it becomes essential. Although this unit concentrates primarily on the analytics phase, certain aspects of data manipulation are also crucial for model construction. Then we also learn about supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning. If I talk about supervisor learning, In this type of learning, a model is created to relate inputs to known outputs. Moreover, In supervised learning, there are two types of problems: classification problems and regression problems. Classification problems involve dividing the data according to a trained algorithm. Linear decision boundaries can be used in some less complex cases, but more complex cases require complicated decision boundaries. Supervised learning includes regression analysis, which examines the relationship between response and predictor variables to create a hyperplane. Now, if I talk about unsupervised learning, the goal is to find patterns and relationships in datasets that don't have any labels or additional information. There are different ways to approach this, including clustering, density estimation, and factor analysis. Clustering involves grouping similar data points together to uncover underlying patterns or different groups within the dataset. The number of clusters can be determined based on the user's expectations and the behavior of the data. A real-  world example of unsupervised learning is the movie recommendation problem, where the goal is to predict movie ratings for users without any labels for the data points. Unsupervised learning tasks can include things like retrieving information, compressing data, detecting anomalies, and understanding and visualizing data. Then we learned about Reinforcement learning which is a machine learning algorithm in which an agent learns to interact with an environment and improve its performance by receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for bad actions. Apart from games, reinforcement learning has various real-world applications, such as robotics, recommendation systems, and autonomous driving. Now if I talk about Model evaluation, When we use machine learning, we need to make sure the model we create can accurately predict things it hasn't seen before. We do this by testing the model on a set of data with known answers that it hasn't seen before. To do this, we split the data into two parts: one to teach the model and one to test how well it learned. We keep trying different ways to teach the model until it can accurately predict new things. It can be hard to figure out the best way to teach the model because there are many ways to group the data and adjust the model. That's why we have to try many different ways to teach the model to find the best one. Furthermore, I want to talk about cross-validation in machine learning that I learned this topic. It's a cool method where we train a model using one dataset and then test it on another. We do this multiple times, rotating the datasets and testing again until we find the best-fit model. But sometimes, we have to be careful not to over-fit our model. Over-fitting happens when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely. This might sound like a good thing, but it leads to poor performance when we try to use the model on new data.  I also came to know about the importance of maths for understanding ML better. Machine learning is based on math and understanding various mathematical concepts is crucial to getting good results. A person who is an expert in these concepts can select and apply models, choose parameters, and know why some models give better results. Some important concepts to explore are vectors, matrices, probability, and using Python programming with different modules and packages. Feature vectors are commonly used to represent data objects like text documents, images, and audio files in ML. A vector is a series of related numbers that show the relationship between the inputs and outputs of data objects. After that, we came across vectors, the concept of cosine similarity, and cosine distance, which are used to measure the similarity and dissimilarity between two vectors. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, while cosine distance measures the angular difference between them. To calculate cosine distance, we subtract the similarity from 1. Now if I talk about a matrix and what I came to know, a matrix is a rectangular or square grid of numbers, and it's an essential element of linear algebra and machine learning. Matrices have rows and columns, and we can perform various operations with them, such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and elementwise multiplication. We can also multiply matrices together, but the order matters, and not all matrices can be multiplied. Matrices can be symmetric, diagonal, or identity, and we can find their transpose and inverse if they exist. Matrices are also related to other concepts, such as determinants, trace, rank, and eigenvalues/eigenvectors. Furthermore, we came across the concept of vector space model, which is a way of representing a set of vectors, which is used  in information retrieval operations such as search engines. We can know the similarity or closeness of two documents based on the calculated Euclidean distance. If talk about python then it will is the most important language that we will use for machine learning, python has packages that make the language simple to use, you don’t need to write from start, and packages do their job and makes thing easy. That’s why it became popular. To set up python on a computer or to install it on or pc we are using anaconda python, Jupyter notebook. After installation, we start to learn python basics like variables, lists, tuples, dictionaries string slicing what are they? And why do we use them? In programming, indentation and decision-making are important concepts and I came to know about them this topic. In Python, code blocks are defined by indentation, and how far a line of code is indented controls the program's structure. Decisions are made by checking the condition of a variable, and the answer is a Boolean value of True or False. Conditionals like if, Elif, and else are used for the conditional execution of code in Python. Proper indentation is important in coding, as it can affect the output of the code. Iteration also plays a key role in programming we use for and while loop for looping purposes. Functions keep the code clean and are an important part of python programming. Functions are blocks of code that we can give a name to, so we can call them whenever we need them. You can also give arguments to functions, which are values that you can use within the function. In Python, functions are defined using the keyword "def" followed by the function name and arguments in parentheses. The function body is indented below. You can use anonymous functions in Python, which are defined using the keyword "lambda". Anonymous functions are like regular functions, but you don't give them a name. They are useful for creating new functions on the fly. After it we also learn about how to use the NumPy library in Python to create vectors and matrices and perform common linear algebra operations on them, and how to import NumPy and matplotlib libraries into a Python environment. Examples of creating vectors and matrices using the np. array function and generating different types of matrices such as all zero, all one, and identity matrices. Additionally, we learn about how to create a matrix with random numbers using the np.random.randn function. we also learn about various matrix operations like division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition of the matrix by using python. we also learn about code examples for manipulating matrices in Python. we cover topics such as slicing, accessing elements, logical checks, and loops.  To conclude, This topic covered a broad understanding of machine learning, its practical uses, subtypes, and evaluation methods. We also had the opportunity to experiment with Python code and were encouraged to use Jupyter Notebook to run the code. The next topic's topics will include exploring Python programming further, using different modules and packages, and learning fundamental concepts of linear algebra, such as vectors, matrices, and operations on them, which are crucial for machine learning algorithms.
