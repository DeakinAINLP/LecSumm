Machine learning can be defined as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without  being  programmed  explicitly  for  the  intended  task .  Machine  learning  involves creating a model by using a large database of training data which is then evaluated and then finally  deployed.  In  simpler  terms  it  learns  from  experience  to  make  predictions.  There  are many real world applications of machine learning including the now popular chat-gpt. There are  three  main  steps  in  machine  learning  data  manipulation,  analytics  and  evaluation  and visualisation.  Course  SIT307  will  be  focussing  on  analytics  step  which  in  includes  finding relationships and correlations, exploratory data analysis and predictive machine learning. Machine  learning  algorithms  can  be  also  classified  as  Supervised  learning,  unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, transduction and learning to learn .  Supervised  machine  learning  creates  models  to  predict  future  instances  by  producing general patterns and hypotheses by using historic or supplied instances . Classification and regression are examples of supervised learning. Unsupervised machine learning infers using unlabelled  data  with  hierarchical  clustering  and  partitioning  as  the  popular  approaches  . Reinforcement learning is a model which is developed based on rewarding desired actions and punishing  undesired  actions.  RL  models  can  make  the  best  decisions  within  context  to maximize success . Machine learning is based on mathematics and a strong knowledge of probability, vector its operations,  matrices  and  its  operations  is  required.  A  good  understanding  of  Python programming is also required for this unit. Python packages that will be commonly used for Machine learning will be NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, matplotlib, Seaborn and scikit learn.
