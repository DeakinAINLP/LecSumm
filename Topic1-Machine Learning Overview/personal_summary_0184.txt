Machine learning involves teaching machines to complete tasks without explicitly programming them. It involves the steps of data manipulation, analytics, evaluation and visualisation. Supervised learning is a form of machine learning where the output is known and the inputs are adjusted until they fit the known outputs. Regression is an example of supervised learning.  Unsupervised learning involves unlabelled data and attempts to find an underlying pattern in the dataset. Two forms of unsupervised learning are clustering and factor analysis. Clustering is grouping similar points together. Reinforcement learning is another form of machine learning. It involves an agent learning from interactions within an environment.  Vectors in machine learning represent data instances. Vectors can be transposed, added, subtracted and multiplied. Vectors also have distance and magnitude.  Reflection: Reading this topicâ€™s content refreshed a lot of concepts about machine learning that I learned from previous units. It refreshed my knowledge on supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. It also reinforced my knowledge on vectors such as transposing and multiplying them.
