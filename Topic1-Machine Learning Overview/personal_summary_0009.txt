Data representation is the organization and presentation of data to facilitate analysis and interpretation. Python programming is a language used to apply programming concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, and file I/O. Python is popular in data analysis and machine learning due to its simplicity. Machine learning builds algorithms that can learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions based on new input. The three main types of machine learning are supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning learns from labeled data, unsupervised learning learns from unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning learns through trial and error based on a reward system. For my better knowledge of machine learning, I have referred to the book ‘Introduction to Algorithms for Data Mining and Machine Learning’ by  Xin-She Yang along with using W3schools for practicing python. I learned several key concepts and techniques used in this field. These include applications of ML in real world along with supervised and unsupervised learning. Overall, an introduction to machine learning provides a foundation for understanding the basics of how models are trained, evaluated, and used to make predictions or decisions based on data.
