 The topics that were covered during topic 1 are What is Machine learning along with some real world applications, the steps involved in machine learning, Overview about supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, glimpse of model selection and evaluation, then mathematics concepts involving vectors, matrices, probability etc. Then, from python standpoint what are the variables types, iterations , branching & decisions, functions, python modules & packages along with operations that can be performed with matrix were covered.  I referred to the unit site contents for learning the topics that were covered in the topic 1 along with the external video links provided.  It all started on what machine is all about with examples of real-world applications. Then, I acquired knowledge about the machine learning steps which involves Data manipulation, Analytics and Evaluation & Visualization. In this unit we will be focusing on the analytics and Evaluation & Visualization part only. I gained an idea on supervised learning along with their types namely classification problems and regression problems. Then, I got an overview of what is unsupervised learning with the clustering approach and also a gist about reinforcement learning. I gathered knowledge about model evaluation and model selection. Then, learnt the key areas of mathematics & machine learning concepts which involves vector and its basic operations, matrices and matrix operations, probability concept and python programming. During the python learning part got familiar with these topics, the variable types, branching & decisions, iterations, function, python modules and packages. Finally, operations that can be done with matrix was learnt.
