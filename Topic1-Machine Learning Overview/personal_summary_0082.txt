Machine Learning  Deﬁning Machine Learning  Machine Learning is a computer program improving its performance with data. Machine Learning is used due to the volume of data available as ML systems can learn and adapt to produce useful results from large amounts of data.  Real-world applications of machine learning machine learning can be used in many places like robotics to get walking patterns, board games like chess and go and Voice Recognition.  Machine learning steps Machine learning involves three main steps: data manipulation, analytics, and evaluation/visualization. The ﬁrst step involves preparing the data. The second step involves ﬁnding relationships and correlations in the data. The ﬁnal step involves evaluating and visualizing.  Supervised Machine learning Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained using labelled data to learn patterns and relationships between input variables and output variables.  Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning involves ﬁnding patterns and structures in unlabelled datasets. One of the popular approaches is clustering, where groups similar data points together.  Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves an agent learning how to make decisions in an environment by trial and error, receiving rewards or punishments for each action taken.
