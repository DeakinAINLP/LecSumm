The major topics covered includes introduction to Machine Learning, its real-world  applications, the in-depth study of the various steps involved in machine learning, the types of machine learning including supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement machine learning, selecting machine learning models and their evaluation and some very important mathematics concepts including vectors, matrices, probability, etc. Python was also covered, and the topics include types of variables, iterations, functions, modules, and packages and using them to perform operations on matrix. The lecture video and the unit site were the most important learning resources.  The learning journey started with introduction to Machine Learning and defining it.  Following this, some very important real-world applications of machine learning was discussed including robotics and voice recognition. As a next step, I gained an understanding of the various machine learning steps including Data manipulation, Analytics, Evaluation and Visualization following which I gained a solid understanding of the types of machine learning â€“ supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. This topic also gave the idea regarding clustering and classification problems. After getting an overview of model evaluation and selection, I got the opportunity to refresh some mathematics concepts dealing primarily with vectors and matrices. The various topics included vector addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, product of two vectors, transpose of a matrix, diagonal matrix, identity matrix etc. Then I switched to python and learned how to use it to perform mathematical operations on matrices. The basic framework knowledge gained included variable types, branching and decisions, iterations and functions, and the various modules and packages in python.
