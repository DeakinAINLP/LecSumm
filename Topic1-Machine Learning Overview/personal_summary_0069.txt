In topic 1 I learnt the definition about Machine learning.  Machine  learning  is  a  subfield  of  artificial  intelligence  that  involves  building  models  capable  of learning  patterns  and  relationships  in  data  and  making  predictions  or  decisions  based  on  that information.  The  process  of  machine  learning  typically  involves  four  steps:  data  preprocessing, model selection, model training, and model evaluation.  Data preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This may include tasks such as data cleaning, data transformation, and feature extraction.  Model selection involves choosing the best model among a set of candidate models. This is typically done by comparing the performance of different models using various evaluation metrics.  Model training involves fitting the selected model to the training data, which involves adjusting the model parameters to minimize the error between the predicted values and the actual values.  Model evaluation involves assessing the performance of the trained model on new, unseen data. This  is  typically  done  by  comparing  the  predicted  values  to  the  actual  values  using  various evaluation metrics.  There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the target variable is known. Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the target variable is unknown. Reinforcement learning involves training a model to make decisions based on feedback received from the environment.  Machine learning has a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, predictive maintenance, fraud detection, and recommender systems.\  There are 3 steps for machine learning Step 1: Data manipulation Step 2: Analytics Step 3: Evaluation and Visualization  ML is based on maths. During topic1 I understand the vectors and basic vector operations, matrices and matrix operations  Vectors are one-dimensional arrays of numbers and are fundamental concepts in linear algebra. They can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided in various ways. The dot product and cross product are important operations used in linear algebra, and vector operations are used in various machine learning algorithms.  In matrix part, I understand column vector and row vector, matrix algebra.
