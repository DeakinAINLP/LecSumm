 The first things we learnt in this topic's content were what machine learning is and what it is used for. Machine learning can be summarised as; a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks T measured by P improves with E. Machine learning can be used for things like, digit recognition, computer vision for classification of objects, and voice recognition.  Machine Learning can be categorised into supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is where the program is given a set of training data to learn off and use to build a model to predict/classify the next set of inputs. Unsupervised learning is the opposite. No training data is given to the program and correlations and relationships have to be formed over time by the program. Reinforcement learning is where the program is “rewarded” for desirable behaviour and “punished” for undesirable behaviour.  We then learnt about model selection and overfitting. Selecting a model really depends on having a good understanding of the data being used as some models would be a better choice than others. For example, linear regression would be a good choice for a dataset with two continuous variables, whereas it might not be a good use case for image classification.  The next topics that were taught were vectors and their operations, and matrices and their operations. One thing that was significant to learn was the euclidean distance between two vectors. This could be used to determine similarity between two points in a multi-dimensional space.  Reflection:  As this is a topic I have had some experience with, a lot of this was reiterating and reinforcing content that I had learnt before. Even though they weren’t new topics, it was definitely a good idea to go over them again and refresh my mind on several topics I hadn’t studied in a while.
