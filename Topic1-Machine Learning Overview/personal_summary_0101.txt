Machine Learning  - “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed” Samuel 1959  -  Robotics -  Computer Vision -  Board games -  Voice Recognition -  Digit Recognition -  Healthcare analytics: diagnosis and prognosis -  Stock market prediction -  Business analytics -  Facial recognition  Machine Learning Steps  -  Step 1: Data Manipulation  -  Process of sampling information that illustrates real world physical conditions -  Data acquired should be reliable for converting into digital numeric values -  Data cleaning involves removing redundancies and ‘noise’  Step 2: Analytics  -  Finding relationships and correlations in the prepared data -  Exploratory data analysis involves summarizing main characteristics or features -  Predictive Machine Learning is last stage; involves statistical techniques to build an intelligent  system for decision making  Step 3: Evaluation and Visualization  - If the quality and performance of the intelligent system does not meet satisfactory outcome, a refinement procedure is required to optimize the system and involves another run-through of data manipulation and analytics  Supervised learning  -  Learning a function (known as model) from data to relate inputs to known outputs.  Supervised learning is trained  -  Datasets have relationships originally  Training and evaluating data  -  Training requires dividing data into training and evaluation data; the majority of the data is used  to develop and train a functional model.  -  The evaluation data can be used to test the model with fresh and unused data  Mathematical definition  -  In supervised learning, training data includes output information (labels/targets)  -  Two types of supervised learning  -  Classification problems  o  Decision boundaries partitions data space into two sets, each of these sets represent one  of the classes; data is divided according to training algorithm  -  Regression problems  ▪    o  Examines the relationship between response variables; results can be on a hyperplane  representing regression analysis  ▪  Unsupervised learning  -  Learns patters using an algorithm from unlabeled data  o  Clustering o  Factor analysis  Clustering  -  Process of grouping similar points together; goal is to find relative similaritites in data points;  gives insight to underlying patterns or groups within the dataset   o  -  Potential tasks for ML unsupervised learning:  Information retrieval  o o  Data compression o  Anomaly detection o  Data understanding the visualization  Reinforcement Learning  -  Agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and learning from  interactions; acts on its environment and receives evaluation based on its action  Model evaluation  -  Always be evaluating models; need to check accuracy of model on test data. For its purpose we  need to  o  Randomly split examples into traiing dataset and test dataset o  Use the training dataset to learn a model o  Evaluate the model using the test dataset and a measurement (such as the accuracy of  prediction)  o  Repeat for different random splits and then average the results o  Check the accuracy of results and try again (iterate) until the model makes useful  predictions   o  Model selection  -  Difficult to find best model therefore have to try different models  - -  Ways to approach this problem  o  Look at averaged evaluation scores on many random test datasets o  Cross-validation, that is train using one dataset and test on another, try rotating them and  test again, for example if you have datasets A, B and C try AIC, BIC etc
