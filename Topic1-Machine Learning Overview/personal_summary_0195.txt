Topic one included the introduction to Machine learning, its applications in real world and discussion about the various mathematical operations that will be used in this unit. From the understanding of topic one Machine learning can be defined as the process where the computer learns from past and keeps on improving its results based on the data. This is very important in Machine learning because based on the model evaluation it can be stated if the predictions that are made are satisfactory or not. There is continuous learning that takes place.  Application of machine learning can be seen in various fields. A few examples that are discussed are board games, voice recognition and others. However there are several steps involved in this that includes data manipulation, analysis, evaluation and visualization. When it comes to learning various types of learnings were discussed such as Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is when the data is labelled and is known while unsupervised learning is when the labels of data are missing. One of the model evaluation techniques used for unsupervised data is clustering. Various mathematical operations like vector operations, matrix operations, probability and python programming were discussed.
