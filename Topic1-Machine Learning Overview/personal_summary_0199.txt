Introduction to machine learning  Module Learning Objectives –  I certify that I have successfully learned and understood the following topics:  1.  Definition of machine learning. 2.  Machine learning steps. 3.  Supervised learning and unsupervised learning. 4.  Reinforcement learning. 5.  Model evaluation and selection. 6.  Vectors and their operations. 7.  Matrix algebra. 8.  Python basics.  Summary and reflection –  The  pages  below  contain  the  handwritten  summary  referring  to  the  given learning resources. It includes all the important points of the topic 1 module.  Like  in  every  unit,  the  basic  introduction  lays  the  path  to  what  we  will  learn later  in  the  unit.  So,  the  given  introduction  provides  a  better  idea  I  had  of machine learning than before. This knowledge will surely come in handy in our professional and day-to-day life as well.  In the second part of the module, we were introduced to the base theories and concepts on which the whole of machine learning is based. Then in the latter part  of  the  theory  section,  we  got  familiarized  with  essential  mathematics including working with vectors and matrices.  I have prior experience in using python therefore I got the programming in the python section very quickly, but it really helped me refresh my knowledge. And the provided pass task including the quiz allowed me to apply what I learnt in this module which helped me understand the concepts better.
