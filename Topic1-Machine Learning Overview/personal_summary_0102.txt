Overall throughout topic one the main purpose for me was a refresher topic especially when it came to the python programming side of things of which I was already familiar. In regards to the linear algebra however, I did need a big refresher as my knowledge was lacking since when I last did it. The video linked by 3Blue1Brown on youtube was of a great help and actually really well explained the concept of eigenvectors and eigenvalues which I had previously never properly understood. The content with pandas and numpy I was also familiar with.
