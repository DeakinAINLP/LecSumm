Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn from data and improve their performance on a given task over time. The three main types of machine learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a model on a labelled dataset to make predictions on new, unseen data. Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns and structure in  unlabelled  data  without  a  specific  task  or  goal  in  mind.  Reinforcement  learning  involves  learning through interaction with an environment, where the model receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions. Machine learning models can be used in a variety of applications, such as image  and  speech  recognition,  natural  language  processing,  recommendation  systems,  and  fraud detection.
