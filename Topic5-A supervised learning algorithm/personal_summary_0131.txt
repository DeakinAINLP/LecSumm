This topic, I understood the importance of dimensional reduction. I have seen the mathematical concepts to solve the curse of dimensions such as eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and singular value decomposition. I have learned the concepts of PCA, tSNE, and UMAP. I have tried the code examples and found some issues while I was trying them. First of all, I have been aware that “plt.show()” is required for Pycharm to show the plots. Secondly, there are unnecessary semicolons in code example #10 in 1.13 and code example #2 in 4.15 that causes errors in Python. Lastly, “import numpy as np” is missing in the first code block of 4.15.
