Topic four covered the concepts of data dimensionality and how to transform data with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We started with data dimensionality where we explored some issues that can occur with high dimensional data and how/why we may wish to reduce dimensionality. After this we focused on the application of data decomposition with  PCA  by  means  of  the  covariance  matrix  and  eigenvalues.  The  last  section  of  the  topic  involved  a  practical application of PCA in Python and how to evaluate and represent the findings.
