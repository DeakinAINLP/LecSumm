In  this  topic  had  explored  the  eigenvalues  and  eigenvectors.  They  are  used  for  linear transformation which to transformer the data point to a new point.  If want to change the directions to a new shape, we can consider by using a matrix. Also, this topic also cover the curse of dimensionality. The increase of dimension, the fraction of volume will also increase. To solve the dimensionality , we can remove the features that is less relevant from the dataset or else we can apply PCA.
