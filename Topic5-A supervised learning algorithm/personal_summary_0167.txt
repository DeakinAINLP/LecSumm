This topic, we covered the following main points related to machine learning:   Clustering: We learned about different clustering algorithms, such as k-means,  hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN, and how they can be used to group data points based on their similarity.    Dimensionality Reduction: We discussed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE, which are techniques used to reduce the number of features in high-dimensional data and visualize it in a lower-dimensional space.    Model Selection and Evaluation: We learned about different methods for selecting and evaluating machine learning models, such as train-test split, cross-validation, and grid search.    Ensemble Learning: We discussed how ensemble learning can improve the performance of machine learning models by combining multiple weaker models to create a stronger one.
