Dimensionality in Data :  Text Data:  Any type of spoken or written language used to transmit information is referred to as text data. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to examine this type of data, which is often provided as a series of characters or phrases. The length of the text (the number of characters or words) and the number of features retrieved from the text are typically the two dimensions of text data (e.g., word frequency, sentiment, topic).  Image Data:  Any visual information, such as pictures, sketches, or graphs, is referred to as image data. Typically, this kind of data is displayed as a matrix of pixel values, where each pixel denotes a different colour value. The three dimensions of image data—height, width, and depth (the quantity of colour channels)—are standard. To represent metadata or other information about the image, extra dimensions may occasionally be added.  Genomic Information:  Information about a person's or a group of people's genetic make-up is referred to as genomic information. The sequence of nucleotides (A, C, G, and T) that make up DNA or RNA molecules is typically used to represent this kind of data. A typical genomic data dimension is the length of the sequence (number of nucleotides). The existence of mutations, the location of genes, or the degree of expression of particular genes can all be represented by additional dimensions.  Curse of dimensionality :  When working with high-dimensional data in machine learning, there are a number of issues that are referred to as the "curse of dimensionality." In essence, the quantity of information needed to generalise accurately from a dataset grows exponentially as the number of dimensions (features) increases. Increased computational complexity, overfitting, and lower predictive accuracy are just a few problems that can result from this.  The fact that there are a growing number of possible feature combinations as the number of dimensions rises is one of the fundamental problems with high-dimensional data. As a result, it becomes harder to find statistically significant patterns or correlations among features, and models may end up being overfit to the noise in the data.  Machine learning has created a number of methods to deal with the problem of dimensionality, including dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and regularisation. These methods are designed to either decrease the number of dimensions in the data or to pinpoint the key characteristics most likely to lead to precise forecasts. Data preparation and sampling are additional methods that can be used to balance the number of dimensions and the size of the dataset in order to prevent overfitting and other problems related to high- dimensional data.  Solving the curse :  Dimensionality Reduction:  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can help us minimise the amount of features in a dataset while still preserving the most crucial data. The original characteristics are converted via PCA into a more manageable collection of principle components, which account for the majority of the variance in the data.  Feature Selection:  From the original dataset, we can choose a subset of the most instructive features using feature selection techniques. For instance, we can rank the features according to how relevant they are to the target variable using a filter method like mutual information, and then pick the top k features.  Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors :  Machine learning frequently makes use of the crucial linear algebraic notions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are frequently used in machine learning for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and other tasks.  The following definitions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors show how they describe the characteristics of a linear transformation, such as a matrix:  An eigenvector x is a non-zero vector that fulfils the following equation for a square matrix A:  A x = λ  where the eigenvalue of the eigenvector x is a scalar value denoted by the symbol.  The Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a machine learning approach for lowering the dimensionality of a dataset by projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace, is one popular application of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The principle components are represented by the data's covariance matrix's eigenvectors, and each principal component's share of the variance is shown by the associated eigenvalues.  We can employ a number of techniques, like the power iteration approach and the QR algorithm, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. In a nutshell, these techniques are as follows:   Power iteration Method :  The dominant eigenvector of a matrix, or the eigenvector that corresponds to the biggest eigenvalue, can be found using the iterative power iteration approach. Repeatedly applying the matrix to a random vector and normalising the outcome are how the process operates. Once the result has been normalised, the eigenvector is updated, and the process is repeated until convergence.  Formulation of PCA and deriving principal components :  Principal component analysis (PCA), also known as principal component mapping (PCM), is a method for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset by mapping the data onto a lower- dimensional subspace while retaining as much of the original information as possible. The idea of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which are matrices' attributes, is the foundation of PCA.  The following formulation represents the PCA algorithm:    Standardise the data: The first step is to take the mean of each feature and subtract it from it, then divide the result by the standard deviation. PCA assumes that the data is centred and standardised.    Create a covariance matrix to measure the linear relationship between pairs of  features. Here's how we compute the covariance matrix:  Cov(X) = (1/n) * X^T X  where X is the centered and standardized data matrix, and n is the number of data points.  Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues:  We compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix using a method such as the power iteration method or the QR algorithm. The eigenvectors represent the directions in which the data varies the most, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector.   Select the principal components:  We select the principal components by choosing the top k eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues. These eigenvectors form a new basis for the data, and the principal components are the projections of the data onto this new basis.  Transform the data:  We transform the data by projecting it onto the new basis formed by the principal components. The transformed data has a lower dimensionality and can be used for further analysis or visualization.  To derive the principal components, we use the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors represent the directions in which the data varies the most, and the principal components are the projections of the data onto these eigenvectors. The first principal component is the direction in which the data varies the most, and each subsequent principal component is orthogonal to the previous ones and represents the direction in which the remaining variance is maximized.  steps for deriving the principal components:  Compute the covariance matrix Cov(X).  Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of Cov(X).  Sort the eigenvectors in descending order of their corresponding eigenvalues.  Select the top k eigenvectors to form the new basis.  Project the data onto the new basis to obtain the principal components.   Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR):  For feature extraction and dimensionality reduction in machine learning, two techniques are used: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR).  ICA is a method for disentangling independent, non-Gaussian components from a multivariate signal. The goal of ICA is to recover the underlying, independent sources from the observed signals under the assumption that the observed signals are linear combinations of these sources. In image and signal processing, ICA is frequently used to separate various noise sources or to extract features from a dataset.  While retaining the underlying structure of the data, NLDR techniques are used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space. When the data has a nonlinear structure that cannot be captured by linear techniques like PCA, NLDR techniques are frequently used. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding), Isomap (Isometric Mapping), and LLE (Locally Linear Embedding) are a few examples of NLDR techniques.  The t-SNE method maps high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space to visualise it. The goal of t-SNE is to reduce the divergence between the original and mapped data by modelling the similarity between pairs of data points using a probabilistic approach. the use of t-SNE for visual
