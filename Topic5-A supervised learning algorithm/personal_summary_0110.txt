Topic 4 summary  The topic for this topic is Dimensionality reduction.  Curse of dimensionality: As the dimensions of a dataset increases, the available data becomes sparser.  Singular value decomposition: It is a technique that divides a matrix into three separate matrices that stand in for the stretching and rotational components of the matrix transformation.  Principle value Analysis:  The main objective of the PCA is to rigidly rotate the axes of t-dimensional axes to a new set of axes that have the properties:   Ordered such as the principal axes captures the highest variance, the 2nd axes capture the 2nd highest variance and so on.   Covariance among each pair of the principal axes is 0(Decorrelation Property).  Principle Axes: The new set of axes.  Performing PCA with eigenvalue decomposition:   Compute data covariance matrix.   Perform Eigen value decomposition.   Reduce dimensions.  t-SNE:  The technique of t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is used to visualize high- dimensional data in two or three dimensions  It is non-linear approach to dimensionality reduction unlike PCA (which is linear).  It identiÔ¨Åes pa(cid:425)erns and relationships in the data and then represents those pa(cid:425)erns in a lower- dimensional space to reduce the complexity of the data.  U-MAP:  UMAP constructs a high dimensional graph representation of the data then optimizes a low-dimensional graph to be as structurally similar as possible where:   Node: represents the data points.   Edges: represents similarities.  UMAP optimizes a low-dimensional representation of the data by minimizing a cost function that balances preservation of the local distances.
