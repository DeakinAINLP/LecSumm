 This topic's topic covered issues of high dimensionality data and various means of reducing them to lower dimension using different techniques for better visualization and analysis. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors being fundamentals to dimensionality reduction was also covered. PCA is one of the dimensionality reduction techniques which maps data onto its principal components and finds patterns in data which helps reduce the number of variables while preserving the most crucial information. The other techniques like Independent component analysis (ICA), t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and uMap were also explored.
