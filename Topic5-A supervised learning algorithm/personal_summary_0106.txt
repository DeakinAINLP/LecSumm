Topic summary  -  This topic we learned about further concepts on clustering like  o  solving the curse of dimensionality o  eigenvalues and eigenvectors o  principal Component Analysis (PCA) o  Python programming : implementing PCA.  -  Organising and analysing data in high dimensional spaces leads to the curse of  dimensionality problem where the space between data points in a lot so data is sparse. -  Dimension reduction techniques are used to deal with this problem and for ML techniques to be applied, one such technique is PCA which is used to reduce dimensionality while training an ML model. PCA is a feature extraction technique which uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors to ultimately convert high data dimensionality into lower dimensional data while retaining most of the information in the data.  -  o  eigenvectors are the the principal components and eigenvalues are their  magnitudes.  -  We also learnt about how to setup and  apply the PCA in python -  Other dimensionality reduction techniques briefly
