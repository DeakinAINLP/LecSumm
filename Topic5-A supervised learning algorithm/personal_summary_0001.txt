This topic's topics focused on managing high-dimensional data through techniques such as solving the curse of dimensionality, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, principal component analysis (PCA), and Python programming for implementing PCA. The curse of dimensionality refers to the difficulties encountered in dealing with high- dimensional data, while eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used in linear algebra to analyse the properties of matrices. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining most of its important information. The course also covered implementing PCA using Python programming. Overall, these topics aim to help manage complex data and make it more accessible for nterpretation and analysis.
