In this topic we are mainly focus on  dimensionality reduction. There are four main areas  covered this topic.  solving the curse of dimensionality     eigenvalues and eigenvectors   principal Component Analysis (PCA)   Python programming: implementing PCA.  Dimensionality is usually referred to attributes or columns of the dataset basically, like name, age, sex and so on. While classification or clustering the data, we need to decide what dimensionalities/columns we want to use to get meaning information.  There  are  many  issues  that  arise  when  analyzing  and  organizing  data  in  high-dimensional  spaces. Therefore, we need Dimensionality reduction, or dimension reduction which is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its intrinsic dimension.  Curse  of  Dimensionality  describes  the  explosive  nature  of  increasing  data  dimensions  and  its resulting exponential increase in computational efforts required for its processing and/or analysis. it is obvious that the curse of dimensionality result in less distinctive distances in in high dimensions. So given a point in high dimensions, the relative distance between points far from it and close to it, becomes negligible.  The  Curse  of Dimensionality  calls  for  Dimensionality Reduction.  Dimensionality reduction refers  to  the process  of  converting  a  set  of  data  having  vast  dimensions  into  data with  fewer  dimensions  while  still making sure that it conveys similar information concisely.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are prominently used in the analysis of linear transformations.  For a given square matrix A if a number Î»  and a vector u satisfy the condition then is called an eigenvalue and is the corresponding eigenvector of  A.  Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set. There are several alternative ways of implementing PCA. . We learnt few techniques which is used for dimensionality reduction. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a method of decomposing a matrix into three other matrices and also PCA.  https://data-warehouses.net/glossary/datadimensions.html  https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/149845/whats-the-meaning-of-dimensionality-and-what-is- it-for-this- data#:~:text=Dimensionality%20is%20the%20number%20of,use%20to%20get%20meaning%20informati on.            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction  https://towardsdatascience.com/curse-of-dimensionality-a-curse-to-machine-learning-c122ee33bfeb
