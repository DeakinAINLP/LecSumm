This topic I learned about the importance of reducing data dimensionality, which is crucial for applying machine learning algorithms. I was introduced to the concept of the curse of dimensionality and learned how to solve it using techniques such as PCA, which involves finding the principal components of the data. I also learned about the mathematical preliminaries, including eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and singular value decomposition. Furthermore, I saw how PCA can be used in practice, with an example of using it in facial image analysis. Additionally, I learned about other dimensionality reduction techniques and how to implement PCA using inbuilt functions in Python. I also saw how to visualize correlated and uncorrelated data and how to use PCA to remove correlation in data affected by the curse of dimensionality. Finally, I was introduced to t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding, another dimensionality reduction technique. Overall, this topic's topics provided a comprehensive understanding of dimensionality in data and the importance of reducing it for machine learning, along with practical implementations using Python. "PCA Clearly Explained" by StatQuest with Josh Starmer is a video tutorial that provides an intuitive explanation of PCA and its applications. This tutorial helped me understand the basic concepts of PCA, such as eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and how they relate to data dimensionality reduction. The video also includes visualizations that helped me understand how PCA works and how it can be applied to different types of data. The "Dimensionality Reduction" chapter in "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop is a more theoretical resource that covers the mathematical foundations of dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. This chapter helped me understand the underlying principles and assumptions behind these techniques, as well as the limitations and trade-offs involved in using them. This topic's content emphasized the importance of reducing data dimensionality for applying machine learning algorithms effectively. I know now that high-dimensional data can suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," where sparsity and noise can make it difficult to extract meaningful patterns.I have understood that by reducing the dimensionality of the data using techniques like PCA, t-SNE, or other dimensionality reduction techniques, we can better capture the underlying structure and extract useful features that can be used for machine learning. Overall, this topic's content provided a comprehensive understanding of dimensionality reduction in machine learning and the importance of reducing data dimensionality for effective analysis and modeling. It covered both the mathematical foundations of dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and their practical applications in Python using Scikit-learn.
