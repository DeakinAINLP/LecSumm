The main topics covered this topic are solution to the curse of dimensionality, eigen values and eigen vectors, principal component analysis and its python implementation. Additional topics covered are singular value decomposition, PCA in image analysis, ICA, uMap and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor embedding.  Reading List This topic involves a lot of mathematics and understanding of concepts associated with dimensionality of data and how to handle highly dimensional data and how it affects machine learning.  From 4.1 to 4.4 dimensionality course and its solution is discussed, then we dive into mathematics of eigen value and eigenvectors in 4.5. From 4.6 to 4.9 SVD and PCA and its physical implementation is discussed. And then in 4.10 its application in facial image analysis is explained.  Other reduction techniques like ICA, t-SNE and uMap are discussed in 4.11 and from here on we dive into the python implementation of these concepts.  Necessary libraries used are matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas and metrics in sklearn. From 4.13 to 4.17 we use  python for 1D  and  2D correlated and uncorrelated data  and its  visualization  and then comes PCA and t-SNE.
