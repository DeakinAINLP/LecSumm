Topic 4 Dimensionality reduction Machine learning  Dimensionality in Data  There are many issues that arise when analysing and organising data in high-dimensional spaces. Data includes images, genomics, and text.  Curse of dimensionality  ■ The Curse of Dimensionality arises when applying machine learning  algorithms to highly-dimensional data.  ■ In machine learning, we face unique problems when analysing and organising  data in high-dimensional spaces.  Solving the curse  The  Curse of Dimensionality calls for Dimensionality Reduction. Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of converting a set of data having vast dimensions into data with fewer dimensions while still making sure that it conveys similar information concisely.  Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization method that decomposes a matrix into three parts: a diagonal matrix of singular values, a matrix of left singular vectors, and a matrix of right singular vectors.  Preliminaries The goal of PCA is to take data points in dimensions, which may be correlated and summarises them by a new set of uncorrelated axes.  The first components capture as much of the variation (or variance) among the data points as possible.
