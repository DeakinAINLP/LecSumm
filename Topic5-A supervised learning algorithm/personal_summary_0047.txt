 This topic, we learned about the topic of dimensionality reduction, and I have learned that it is a common technique used in data analysis to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining most of the relevant information. The curse of dimensionality refers to the challenge of accurately representing a high-dimensional dataset, which can lead to overfitting and poor performance of machine learning models. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction, which works by identifying a set of orthogonal axes called principal components that capture the maximum amount of variation in the data. All of this topic's topics are linking with last topic's, which are now helping me get a deeper understanding of the foundations of machine learning.  In addition to PCA, I also learned about other commonly used techniques for dimensionality reduction, such as t-SNE, LLE, MDS, UMAP, LDA, and Factor Analysis using the provided external sources (Youtube videos and LinkedIn learning). These techniques have different strengths and weaknesses and are used depending on the specific requirements of the analysis. For example, t-SNE is useful for visualizing high-dimensional data, while LDA is useful for classification problems.  Overall, I have gained a deeper understanding of the importance of dimensionality reduction in handling high-dimensional datasets, which can help improve the performance of machine learning models, reduce overfitting, and aid in data visualization. The choice of technique depends on the specific requirements of the analysis and the characteristics of the dataset.  Moreover, the whole set up instructions and provided code helped me get a headstart to complete the given problem solving.
