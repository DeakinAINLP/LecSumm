In my topic 4 of the machine learning class, I studied the topic of dimensionality  reduction in data. This topic's lectures were all about how high dimensional data can be difficult  to work with and can lead to overfitting, which is why dimensionality reduction techniques are  used. The main technique covered in this topic's lectures was Principal Component Analysis  (PCA), which is used to reduce the dimensionality of data. The topic was a bit challenging at  first, but after reading through the study materials, I was able to learn and implement the  dimensionality concept in data.  From my understanding of the class, the primary concepts on dimensionality in data is  how it refers to the number of features or variables in a dataset. High dimensional data can be  difficult to work with and can lead to the curse of dimensionality. The curse of dimensionality  refers to the phenomenon where the performance of machine learning models degrades as the  number of features or dimensions in the data increases. This is due to the sparsity of high-  dimensional data and the increased number of possible combinations of features.  To solve the curse of dimensionality, we learned about various techniques like PCA and  t-SNE. In PCA, we discussed the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which are important  concepts in linear algebra and are used in PCA to determine the principal components of a  dataset. We also learned about Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which is a technique used  in linear algebra that is closely related to PCA. It can be used to decompose a matrix into its  constituent parts.  We then went on to discuss the preliminary concepts related to PCA, including  covariance matrices, variance, and the importance of feature scaling. We also covered the  mathematical formulation of PCA and how to derive the principal components of a dataset using  eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We learned how to implement PCA in Python using NumPy, and  saw an example of how PCA can be used for facial image analysis.  Apart from PCA, we also discussed other dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE  and Random Projections. We then moved on to practical exercises in the course, which included  the installation of necessary libraries and tools. We were provided with a Python practical  exercise using independent and correlated data to demonstrate the effectiveness of PCA in  reducing dimensionality and removing correlations in the data. There was also a video that  demonstrated the differences in visualization between correlated and uncorrelated data.  Finally, we discussed how PCA can be used to remove correlations in high-dimensional  data, thereby mitigating the curse of dimensionality. We learned how to use inbuilt Python  functions to perform PCA on a dataset. We also covered t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor  Embedding (t-SNE), which is a dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly useful for  visualizing high-dimensional data.  Overall, topic 4 of our machine learning class was packed with information and provided  a comprehensive understanding of dimensionality reduction techniques. The lectures were very  informative and the practical exercises provided hands-on experience with PCA and other  techniques. The topic concluded with a solid understanding of how dimensionality reduction can  be used to improve the performance of machine learning models on high-dimensional datasets.  The topic was a bit intense and acted as a build up to the previous topicâ€™s studies. The study  requires a bit more work on my end to gain more understanding and do practice on the same on  various datasets.
