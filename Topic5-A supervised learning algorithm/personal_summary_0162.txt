The number of characteristics or variables utilised for expressing each data point or instance in a dataset is referred to as dimensionality in machine learning. It is the amount of input qualities or factors that are considered when building a machine learning model.  Every point of data in a high-dimensional dataset may be characterised by an extensive set of characteristics. A dataset's dimensionality is an important aspect that can affect the accuracy and complexities of machine learning methods. The curse of dimensionality describes the difficulties and problems that come when dealing with large amounts of data.  When using machine learning techniques to extremely dense data, the curse of dimensionality manifests itself. In the setting of machine learning, the issues connected with the curse of dimensions grow more evident as the number of dimensions grows.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are linear algebra notions that are important in many domains, including machine learning and data analysis. They are related with square matrix structures and give crucial insights into the matrices' characteristics and operations.  Eigenvalues are scalar values that reflect the scaling factors used to convert eigenvectors when multiplied by a specified square matrix. An eigenvalue solves the following equation for a square matrix A:  A * v = λ * v  v is the eigenvector and λ is the corresponding eigenvalue.  Eigenvectors do not have a unique value, which means that every scalar multiple of an eigenvector additionally represents an eigenvector for the exact same eigenvalue. Eigenvectors with different eigenvalues are linearly independent.  The singular value decomposition (SVD) technique divides a matrix into three additional matrices. It is a versatile linear algebra tool with uses in data analysis, signal processing, and machine learning. A matrix A's SVD is provided by:  A = U * S * V^T  Where:    U is an orthogonal matrix that represents A's left singular vectors.   S is a diagonal matrix containing non-negative values known as singular values.   VT is the orthogonal matrix transposed to represent the right singular vectors of A.  The dimensionality reduction approach t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) is often used for visualising high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional    domain. It is especially good at retaining the local structure and connections between data points, which makes it valuable for examining and analysing large datasets.  PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a method for reducing dimensionality commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. Its goal is to reduce a highly dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space while retaining the most relevant details or trends in the data.  The primary purpose of PCA is to determine the paths or axes over which the data has the most variation. These axes, referred to as primary parts, are orthogonal to one another. We may successfully decrease the dimensionality of the data by projecting it onto these primary elements.  t-SNE is ideal for visualising and interpreting complicated, high-dimensional data, with a focus on local interactions and clusters. It aids in the discovery of patterns and structures that may not have been seen in the original space. PCA, on the other hand, presents a global picture of the data, emphasising the most significant sources of variation while sometimes missing fine-grained local correlations. Both strategies have advantages and disadvantages in data analysis and visualisation jobs.
