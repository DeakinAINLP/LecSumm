Dimensionality in Data Attributes (AKA: columns, features or variables) are added to dimension of data.  Curse of dimensionality  ● The higher the data = The higher the attributes = Complexity of data increase =  Analysing / visualisation difficulty increase  Concentration Effect (Law of Large numbers) Refers to the conditions where the number of features / dimensions in the data rises, the effectiveness of a measure of distance decreases.  Solving the Curse Dimension reduction: Process to help simplify the data by decreasing the amount of attributes at the same time continue to store important information. For example a person's weight and height. Height will be independent; the height doesn't depend on the weight. Weight however is dependent as the height increases the weight will increase as well.  Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  ● Maths concept used in order to analyse / understand behaviour of linear  transformation. For example matrix multiplication  ● Eigenvalues = Matrix stretch / shrinks a vector ● Eigenvectors = Find the direction of vector being stretch / shrink ● For example: A rubber being stretch  ○ Eigenvalues: The amount being stretch ○ Eigenvectors: Which direction it is being stretch  ● Equation: Au = λu ○ A = matrix ○ u = vector / Eigenvectors ○ λ = Scaler / Eigenvalues  Singular value decomposition (SVD)  ● Method used reduce / decomposing the matrix into 3 other matrices (  dimensionality of data)  ● X = USV ^ T  ○ X = n * d : matrix (matrix input) ○ U = n * d : orthogonal matrix ○ S = d * d : diagonal matrix with elements (singular values) ○ V = d * d : orthogonal matrix  Preliminaries  ● Refers to what needs to be done before using PCA (principal component  analysis). Such as data preprocessing, cleaning, etc….  Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  ● Method used for dimensionality reduction  What are the Steps ?  1. Data Collecting: Collecting data that we want to analysis 2. Data Standardise: Make data consistent 3. Covariance Matrix calculation: Structure relationship separation in matrix 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors calculation: refer above 5. Sort Eigenvectors in descending order: The highest eigenvalues will be the chosen data
