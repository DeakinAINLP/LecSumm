   Dimensionality in Data：  1. Text data: In the case of a news website, crawling and extracting information from the site for a short period can result in more than 10,000 dimensions. These dimensions correspond to the size of the dictionary built based on the words extracted from the news documents. Each document is represented based on the words in the dictionary, forming a feature vector as discussed in topics 1 and 2. 2. Image data: When using pixels as features, even a small 60x60 image results in 4,096 dimensions. 3. Genomic data: In medical research, genomic data often involves a large number of dimensions. For instance, Parkinson's disease case-control data has 408,803 Single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while Alzheimer's disease has 380,157 SNPs.   Curse of Dimensionality: This term refers to the problems that arise when working with high-dimensional data, particularly in machine learning. As the number of dimensions increases, the volume of the space grows exponentially, making the data sparse and less useful.    Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: These are essential concepts in linear algebra used in the analysis of linear transformations. Given a square matrix A, if a number λ and a vector u satisfy the condition Au = λu, then λ is an eigenvalue and u is the corresponding eigenvector of A.    Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): SVD is a method for decomposing a matrix into three other matrices (U, S, and V). It represents an expansion of the original data in a coordinate system where the covariance matrix is diagonal.    Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique  that takes n data points in d dimensions, which may be correlated, and summarizes them by a new set of uncorrelated axes called principal components. These axes are linear combinations of the original d dimensions and are sorted in descending order based on the captured variance along each axis.
