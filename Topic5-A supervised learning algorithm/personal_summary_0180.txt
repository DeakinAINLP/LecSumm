Summarise the main points that is covered in this topic.  PCA   is to summarize data points by a new set of uncorrleated  axes   data normalization   find covariance matrix by Xtranspose%X / m   then find eigenvectors to decorrelate data   percentage of variance explained by components  t-SNE   change locations of data points according to the  t-distribution, gather points into clusters  2. Provide summary of your reading list – external resources,  websites, book chapters, code libraries, etc.   SKlearn web - how to load diabetes data   Stackoverflow - t-SNE
