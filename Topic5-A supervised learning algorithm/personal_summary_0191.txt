This topic covers the topic of dimensionality reduction techniques, with a focus on principal component analysis (PCA). The following are the main points covered in this topic:  ➢  The concept of dimensionality in data and the curse of dimensionality, which refers to the  difficulties in analyzing high-dimensional data.  ➢  Techniques to solve the curse of dimensionality, such as feature selection and feature extraction. ➢  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which are used in PCA to find the principal components of a dataset. ➢  Singular value decomposition (SVD), which is a matrix factorization technique that can also be used  for dimensionality reduction.  ➢  The formulation of PCA and how to derive principal components from a dataset. ➢  Implementation of PCA using Python. ➢  Practical examples of working with independent and correlated data, as well as visualizing  correlated and uncorrelated data using Python.  ➢  PCA using inbuilt functions in Python.  Overall, this topic provides an in-depth understanding of dimensionality reduction techniques and their applications, with a focus on PCA.
