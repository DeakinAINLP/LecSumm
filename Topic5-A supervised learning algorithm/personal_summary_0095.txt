This topic we covered dimensionality reduction, specifically focusing on the process of PCA.  The curse of dimensionality – Problems arise when we try to analyse/organise data in high dimensional spaces (data with a lot of features). When dimensionality increases, the data becomes sparser which is a problem since there is likely not enough data to make meaningful analysis. It also makes visualisation impossible for dimensions greater than 3. Can be solved by reducing the number of dimensions.  PCA – A process for reducing the number of dimensions in a data set by reducing the number of features. The aim is to identify patterns in the data and distil the data into their most important features. Although some data is lost in the process, it makes the data more meaningful for analysis.
