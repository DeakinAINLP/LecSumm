Topic  four  covered  dimensionality  reduction,  which  involves  several  key  topics  in including  fundamental  concepts  such  as  normal  distribution, linear  algebra, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. The lecture also delved into various methods of scaling and  normalisation,  such  as  using  min-max  and  standard  deviation  to  scale  data. Additionally,  the lecture  provided  a  deep  understanding  of  single  values decomposition and principal component analysis, including sci-kit functions in Python. Other  topics  included  the  visualisation  of  correlated  and  uncorrelated  data,  and  t- Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding.
