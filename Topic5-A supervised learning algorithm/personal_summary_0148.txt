  Summary  o  Eigenvalues:  Eigenvalues  are  a  linear  algebra  term  used  to  explain  the characteristics  of  a  square  matrix  or  a  linear  transformation.  They  are  a collection of scalars multiplied by a vector to produce a scaled version of that vector. Given a square matrix A and a scalar λ, λ is an eigenvalue of A if a non- zero vector x exists such that Ax = λx. Eigenvalues are significant because they help us comprehend linear transformation and matrix features like invertibility and  singularity.  They're  also  employed  in  things  like  principal  component analysis, signal processing, and quantum physics. Eigenvalues may be computed using a variety of approaches, including the characteristic polynomial method, power iteration, and the QR algorithm.  o  Eigenvectors: Eigenvectors are vectors that are related with eigenvalues and are used to understand how a matrix or a linear transformation affects a vector. If Ax  =  λx,  where  x  is  a  non-zero  vector,  an  eigenvector  of  a  square  matrix  A corresponds to an eigenvalue λ. Eigenvectors may be used to more efficiently describe a matrix or a transformation, and they have a variety of uses, including determining the directions of highest variance in a dataset, encoding signals, and characterising  wave  functions  in  quantum  physics.  Eigenvectors  can  be computed  using  methods  such  as  the  power  iteration  approach,  the  QR algorithm, and, most often, the eigendecomposition method.  o  Singular value decomposition: The technique of singular value decomposition (SVD)  divides  a  matrix  into  three  components:  a  diagonal  matrix  of  singular values, a matrix of left singular vectors, and a matrix of right singular vectors. Many  data  analysis  applications  use  SVD,  including  data  compression,  noise reduction, image processing, and recommender systems. The power iteration technique, the Lanczos algorithm, and the QR decomposition method may all be used to compute SVD.  o  Curse  of  Dimensionality:  The  curse  of  dimensionality  refers  to  the  difficulties that  arise  when  working  with  high-dimensional  data  in  machine  learning  and data analysis. As the number of features in a dataset increases, the amount of data required to generalize accurately grows exponentially, making it difficult to find meaningful patterns or relationships in the data. This can lead to overfitting and  make  it  difficult  to  interpret  results.  Techniques  such  as  dimensionality reduction, feature selection, clustering, and visualization can be used to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.  o  Concentration Effect: The law of big numbers, commonly known as the central limit theorem, says that as the size of a random sample  selected from a large population  rises,  the  sample  mean  converges  towards  the  true  population mean. This phenomena is essential in many domains, including survey research, statistical inference, and machine learning, since it allows researchers to draw correct  predictions  about  a  population  based  on  a  representative  sample. However,  biases  in  the  sampling  process  or  other  factors  might  alter  the   accuracy  of  the  results,  and  the  concentration  effect  presupposes  that  the sample is selected at random from a suitably large population.  o  Solving Curse of Dimensionality: The curse of dimensionality is a difficulty that develops  when  working  with  high-dimensional  data  in  machine  learning  and data analysis. To address this issue, techniques like as dimensionality reduction, feature  selection,  clustering,  visualization,  and  the  inclusion  of  domain knowledge can be applied. Dimensionality reduction algorithms like as PCA and t-SNE  seek  to  minimise  the  number  of  features  in  a  dataset  while  retaining critical  information.  Mutual  information,  correlation-based  feature  selection, and recursive feature elimination are feature selection strategies that pick the most useful features from a dataset. Clustering is the process of grouping similar data  points  together  in  order  to  uncover  patterns  or  correlations  in  high- dimensional  data.  High-dimensional  data  may  be  explored  using  visualisation techniques  such  as  scatter  plots,  heat  maps,  and  parallel  coordinates.  By concentrating  on  the  most  important  aspects,  domain  knowledge  can  assist minimise dimensionality. These strategies aid in the identification of patterns or correlations  in  large  amounts  of  data  and  increase  the  accuracy  of  machine learning models.  o  Principal Component Analysis: PCA is a dimensionality reduction approach used in machine learning and data analysis to convert a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional representation while maintaining the relevant information. It works by finding the main components, which are the directions of highest variation in the dataset, and producing a new set of orthogonal variables ranked by  the  amount  of  variance  they  explain  in  the  data.  PCA  is  utilised  in  a  wide variety of applications, including image processing, data reduction, and pattern identification.  It  offers  various  advantages,  including  the  ability  to  reduce dimensionality while maintaining critical information and identifying the data's most  relevant  properties.  It  does,  however,  presume  linearity  and  may  not function well with non-linear datasets.    Reading list: Lecture Slides, Lecture Recordings, Learning Contents.   My reflections: This topic, we spoke about eigenvalues, eigenvectors, singular value decomposition,  the  curse  of  dimensionality,  the  concentration  effect,  and  principal component  analysis,  among  other  things.  (PCA).  Eigenvalues  and  eigenvectors  are used to understand matrix or linear transformation properties and can be computed in a variety of ways. The curse of dimensionality refers to the difficulty of analysing high-dimensional data. SVD is a matrix factorization technique used in data analysis. Techniques  like  as  dimensionality  reduction,  feature  selection,  grouping,  and visualisation can help to alleviate this problem. According to the concentration effect, as sample size rises, the sample mean converges to the real population mean, allowing accurate  population  forecasts.  PCA  is  a  dimensionality  reduction  approach  that converts  high-dimensional  data  into  a  lower-dimensional  representation  while preserving important information. It finds the major components, which are the data's directions of greatest variance.
