 This  topic's  topics  focused  on  the  concept  of  Dimensionality  Reduction  and  its  various techniques,  including  Eigenvalues  and  Eigenvectors,  Singular Value  Decomposition  (SVD), Curse of Dimensionality, Solving Curse of Dimensionality, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors are essential concepts in linear algebra that can be used to reduce the  dimensions  of  data.  SVD  is  another  method  that  can  be  utilized  for  dimensionality reduction, which breaks down a matrix into three components - left singular vectors, singular values, and right singular vectors. The Curse of Dimensionality is a phenomenon that arises when working with high-dimensional data,  resulting  in  difficulties  such  as  sparsity  and  a  higher  number  of  samples  needed  to maintain the same level of accuracy as the number of features increases. To address the Curse of Dimensionality, several techniques such as feature selection, feature extraction, and regularization can be used. PCA is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction, which involves identifying the principal  components  of  a  dataset.  It  entails  calculating  the  covariance  matrix  of  the  data, determining the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix, and projecting the data onto the eigenvectors to obtain the principal components.
