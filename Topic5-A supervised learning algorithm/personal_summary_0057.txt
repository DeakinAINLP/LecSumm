Analysing and structuring data in high-dimensional areas presents several challenges. Some typical dimensions of the data are text data, image data, and genomic data. Applying machine learning techniques to highly dimensional data leads to The Curse of Dimensionality. Analysing and arranging data in high-dimensional spaces presents special challenges for machine learning. The space expands so quickly as the dimension grows that the amount of data becomes sparse. Since there isn't enough information locally, this is extremely problematic.  The fundamental rule of the curse of dimensionality is that as the number of dimensions rises, the number of regions must also rise exponentially. Every data point has greater room as the number of regions and available space both grow. Our data become sparse and, in some ways, less helpful as a result. At high-dimensional spaces, the majority of the training data is located at the corners of the hypercube defining the feature space. It is also evident that the problem with dimensionality causes distances in high dimensions to be less distinct. As a result, when a point is in large dimensions, the relative distance between distant and nearby points is insignificant. The measure's ability to distinguish between close and remote neighbours is diminished. As the dimensionality rises, there is less relative distinction between nearby and distant neighbours. This is referred to as the distance measure's concentration effect.  This issue may indicate that:    In high dimensions, methods like clustering or KNN could be useless. High- dimensional patterns might still exist, though. Better distance measures are simply required.    We should strive to minimise the dimensionality whenever possible up till better  distance measurements are developed.  The solution to The Curse of Dimensionality is Dimensionality Reduction. Dimensionality reduction is the process of transforming a set of data with many dimensions into data with fewer dimensions while ensuring that it still effectively communicates the same information.  Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  In the analysis of linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are frequently utilised. 𝜆 is referred to as an eigenvalue and µ is the associated eigenvector of A if a number 𝜆  and a vector µ satisfy the criteria Aµ= 𝜆µ for a given square matrix A.  Singular Value Decomposition  A matrix can be divided into three additional matrices using the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique:           𝑋 = 𝑈𝑆𝑉𝑇                      where X is n x d matrix, U is n x d orthogonal matrix, S is d x d diagonal matrix with elements 𝑆(𝑖, 𝑖) = 𝜎𝑖and V is d x d orthogonal matrix.  A real or complex matrix is factored by the SVD in linear algebra. In a coordinate system where the covariance matrix is diagonal, the SVD indicates an expansion of the original data. Singular values of the matrix X are used to refer to the diagonal members of S, 𝜎𝑖's.  Preliminaries  The purpose of PCA is to summarise data points across dimensions that may be associated using a new set of uncorrelated axes. The principal components or principal axes are the uncorrelated axes. The basic dimensions are linearly combined to create these axes. As much variation (or variance) as is feasible between the data points is captured by the first component.    Variance across each variable: A cloud of dots in a multidimensional space with one  axis for each of the variables is how data is visualised. Each variable's mean determines the centroid of the points. Each variable's variance is the average squared deviation of its values from the variable's mean.    Covariances among variables: Covariance measures the relationship between  changes in one variable and changes in another variable. The covariances of the variables show the degree of linear correlation between them.    Covariance matrix: The covariance matrix is a matrix that includes the variances of all the variables on the diagonal and the covariances between all the pairs of variables in the entries that are not on the diagonal.    PCA decorrelation: PCA's primary goal is to rigorously rotate the t-dimensional axes to a  new set of axes (known as principal axes) that have the following characteristics. Ordered so that principal axis- catches the most variance, followed by axis-2, axis-2,...., and axis-d, which has the least variance. Since the principal axes are orthogonal to one another and are therefore uncorrelated, there is no covariance between any two of them. It is known as the decorrelation property.  Implementation of PCA  PCA can be implemented in a variety of different ways. PCA when there are n<d data. There are instances where the ratio of the number of data points (n) to the number of dimensions (d), or n<d, exists.  Using PCA for facial image analysis  Steps for the process:    Create a covariance matrix for the given data.  Identify the data's fundamental eigenvectors.   Determine the energy required to maintain face images when K principle    eigenvectors are employed. It is seen how the final image quality is impacted by different k values and why choosing a lesser number for k might be advantageous for a classifier by projecting data back after maintaining only K axis of variation (using only K primary eigenvectors).  Independent Component Analysis (ICA)  ICA is a technique for disentangling independent, non-Gaussian components from a multivariate signal. ICA is frequently used to separate signals that are muddled together, such as in a complicated sound or visual signal, in signal processing, machine learning, and neuroscience. Finding a set of basic functions that capture the signal's underlying sources is the main objective of ICA. Using these functions, the signal is then divided into its component parts.  uMap  A novel dimensionality reduction method called uMap operates nearly indistinguishably from tSNE. However, it also provides certain further benefits over tSNE.  Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  The orthogonal transformation of the input data into its principal components is the primary goal of PCA. Axis of maximum variation in this case is the principal component. The Principle Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm will be used for two objectives : Dimensionality reduction and data decorrelation (summarization).  In the practical, we will create data in one or more dimensions using a predefined distribution. For the sake of illustration, we'll adopt a normal distribution with a predetermined mean and standard deviation. When producing data in more than one dimension, there are two options to think about: producing data from each dimension separately or producing data from several dimensions so that the dimensions of the data are associated up to a certain value.  Using the subsequent steps to implement PCA:  Implement PCA using python in-built function.    Normalize the data.    Dimensionality Reduction.   Measure Reconstruction Error.  What percentage of information was lost following dimensionality reduction? We compute our data's reconstruction error to quantify this. Reconstruction error is determined by  taking the square root of the squared sum of all the mistakes for each data point. In essence, this is the separation between the original and the reconstructed data point.
