This module covered dimensionality, what it is, when itâ€™s a problem and how to work around it. A dataset can have any number of features, in fact the more features the more nuanced a model can be. There are multiple issues with features, some may be redundant,  extremely correlated (where one feature would suffice), or the overall impact is really small which occurs when the data become sparse as more features are added (the likelihood of features a, b, c & d occurring start to get smaller and smaller. Additionally, at this stage we are unable to plot anything that has more than 3 dimensions (as that is the plane that we exist on).
