1)In topic 4 we have learned about dimensionality in data and types of the data which we are going to learn are text data, image data and genomic data. Text data is simply defined as text which you have extracted and would be dimensions and image data is represented in the form of pixels whereas genomic data is defined as the case data. 2) Eigenvalues are a unique collection of scalar values connected to a set of linear equations that are most likely seen in matrix equations. The characteristic roots are another name for the eigenvectors. It is a non-zero vector that, after applying linear transformations, can only be altered by its scalar component. 3)Singular value decomposition (SVD) is defined as a method of factorization that divides every matrix into three basic and well-known matrices. It has several interesting uses in image processing and machine learning. 4)Then we have learned about Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which is defined as a statistical and computational method for identifying unknown variables that are the root causes of a group of random variables, observations, or signals. For the observed multivariate data, which is often provided as a large database of samples, ICA defines a generative model. 5)Then we had a practical session which is related to python on the topic of independent and correlated data where we have performed practical in 3 different cases 1D ,2D AND 3D. 6)Curse of dimensionality is defined as the challenges that an algorithm for machine learning has when working with data in higher dimensions that did not exist in lower dimensions. This is since the minimal data needs rise quickly as you add dimensions.
