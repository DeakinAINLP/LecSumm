The main points covered in this topic are all about dimensionality in data, solving the curse of dimensionality in data, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Principal Component Analysis, visualisation of correlated and uncorrelated data and other dimensionality reduction techniques. Then we started to implement PCA using python, learn PCA to remove correlation in data and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding.
