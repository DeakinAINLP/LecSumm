 Different datasets can have varying dimensionality, the curse of dimensionality is  where increasing the number of dimensions also increases the distances between data points which can cause algorithms such as K nearest neighbors to function unpredictably or incorrectly. This issue is usually fixed by decreasing the number of dimensions.  Eigenvectors are vectors that only get scaled after transformation and the  eigenvalue is the factor that the eigenvector gets scaled by after a given transformation.  Singular value decomposition is a factorization of a matrix into three matrices. It is used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset  PCA is a method of reducing dimensions in a dataset
