The main points that were covered this topic revolve around dimensionality reduc(cid:415)on and dealing with data that has numerous features. Knowledge learnt to perform dimensionality reduc(cid:415)on included a recap of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, along with singular value decomposi(cid:415)on. The main dimensionality technique that was covered was PCA, and how PCA works was explained. We learnt to use PCA to reduce the dimensions to a speciﬁed number, and subsequently learnt how to get back to the original data from the reduced data. A(cid:332)er reconstruc(cid:415)on, we learnt how to calculate reconstruc(cid:415)on error, which is the diﬀerence between the original point and the point once dimensionally reduced.
