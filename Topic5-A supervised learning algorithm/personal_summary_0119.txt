During this topic, I covered several essential concepts related to machine learning. Clustering was one of the topics, which involves grouping data points based on their similarity. Several algorithms can be used for clustering, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. These algorithms can be used to identify patterns in data, which can then be used to make predictions or gain insights.    Another essential concept I learned about was dimensionality reduction. This  technique involves reducing the number of features in high-dimensional data to make it more manageable and easier to visualize. Two techniques commonly used for dimensionality reduction are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE.    Model selection and evaluation were also discussed during this topic. Several methods are available for selecting and evaluating machine learning models, including train-test split, cross-validation, and grid search. These methods can help to identify the best model for a given task and to prevent overfitting, which is when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data.    Ensemble learning was another topic we covered during this topic. This technique involves combining multiple weaker models to create a stronger one. Ensemble learning can improve the performance of machine learning models and help to overcome some of the limitations of individual models.  To support my learning during this topic, I used several external resources, websites, and code libraries. Scikit-learn is a popular Python library that provides a wide range of algorithms and tools for machine learning. I also used Matplotlib and Seaborn, two Python libraries for data visualization.  Overall, I gained a lot of knowledge during this topic about different machine learning techniques and their applications. I learned about the importance of data pre-processing, model selection, and evaluation in the machine learning pipeline. I also learned how to use different libraries and tools to perform clustering, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble learning. By the end of the topic, I felt more confident in my understanding of machine learning concepts and how to apply them to real-world problems.
