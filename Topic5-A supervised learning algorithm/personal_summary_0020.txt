Summarize the main points that is covered in this topic.  This topic We covered the concepts and issues surrounded by multidimensional data.  We discussed the issues that arise with higher dimensional data known as the curse of dimensionality. In summary as more dimensions are added data points become more sparse and less useful.  To alleviate this problem, we use a technique known as dimensionality reduction. This works by reducing the number of dimensions while ensuring that the model still conveys similar information.  The accuracy of the generated model can be determined by attempting to reconstruct the data and measuring the reconstruction error, that being how close the reconstructed data is to the original dataset.
