  This topic we discussed Dimensionality Reduction. Often the data we are analysing as data scientists and machine learning engineers has a very high number of features or dimensions. This can be very difficult to visualize and can cause computation to be expensive. Additionally it can cause overly complex models to calculate future data points.  Some methods we investigated to reduce dimensionality included Singular Value Decomposition – decomposing a matrix into three matrices  USVT, Principle Component Analysis – reducing the matrix into it’s principle components that are linear combinations of the features to define the data and Independent Component Analysis which aims to separate signals that are mixed together. .
