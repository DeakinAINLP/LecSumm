Eigenvector is a vector that, when multiplied by a matrix, results in a scaled version of the original vector. The scaling factor is known as the Eigenvalue. In machine learning, Eigenvectors are commonly used to represent features of a dataset, while Eigenvalues indicate the importance of each feature. For example, in principal component analysis (PCA),  a  popular  dimensionality  reduction  technique  used  in  machine  learning,  the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data are used to identify the most important features and project the data onto a lower dimensional space.  SVD  is  a  matrix  factorization  technique  that  decomposes  a  given  matrix  into  three matrices:  U,  Σ,  and  V,  where  U  and  V  are  orthogonal  matrices,  and  Σ  is  a  diagonal matrix with the singular values of the original matrix. SVD is particularly useful when working  with  large  datasets  or  matrices,  as  it  enables  us  to  represent  the  data  in  a compact form while preserving the most important information. For example, in image processing, SVD can be used to compress images while retaining the most important features, reducing storage requirements and processing time.  The Curse of Dimensionality is a problem that occurs when the number of features or dimensions  in  a  dataset  increases,  leading  to  sparse  data  and  decreased  model performance. As the number of dimensions increases, the amount of data required to accurately represent the distribution of the data increases exponentially, making it more challenging to process and analyse.  To  solve  the  Curse  of  Dimensionality,  several  techniques  have  been  developed  in machine learning. One of the most used techniques is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is a dimensionality reduction technique. PCA works by identifying the principal components, which are the linear combinations of the original features that explain  the  most  variance  in  the  data.  These  principal  components  are  then  used  to represent the data in a lower-dimensional space while preserving the  most important information.  PCA  is  particularly  useful  for  reducing  the  dimensionality  of  high-dimensional datasets, as it allows us to represent the data in a more compact form while retaining the most important features. By reducing the number of dimensions, we can also reduce the complexity of the model, making it easier to interpret and analyse.
