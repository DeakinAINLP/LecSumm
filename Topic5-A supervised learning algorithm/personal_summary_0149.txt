In Machine Learning datasets, dimensions are the features or simply the columns in the dataset. A dataset with high-dimensional data can lead to overfitting, increased computational complexity, and reduced performance of algorithms. Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of reducing the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible.  A square matrix is divided into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues using the matrix decomposition method known as eigenvalue decomposition, or eigen decomposition. While eigenvalues indicate how much each eigenvector has been stretched or compressed, eigenvectors are the directions along which a linear transformation affects the data.  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much information as possible.  PCA works by finding the principal components of the data, which are linear combinations of the original features that capture the most variance in the data. The first principal component is the direction in the data that captures the most variance, the second principal component is the direction that captures the most variance orthogonal to the first principal component, and so on.  t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that is well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data for visualization in a low- dimensional space of two or three dimensions.
