Dimensionality Reduction  Learning Report  The fourth topic introduces a very important concept in machine learning which is dimensionality reduction. Some of the notable points that were explored during the fourth topic include: Curse of Dimensionality:  The Curse of Dimensionality is a common problem encountered in many fields, including machine learning, statistics, and data analysis. It refers to the challenges that arise when working with high-dimensional datasets, including sparsity of data, exponential growth of possible configurations, and difficulties in exploring or searching for relevant variables. Curse of dimensionality often leads to overfitting and poor ÔÅ¨ Dimensionality Reduction: generalization performance of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of minimizing the number of features or dimensions in a dataset while retaining the maximum amount of information. Numerous techniques exist for dimensionality reduction, such as principal component analysis (PCA), Scaling: singular value decomposition (SVD), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Performing standardization prior to PCA is essential because PCA can be affected by variations in the original features. If the initial variables have different ranges, those with larger ranges may have a greater impact on the analysis than those with smaller ranges. This can result in biased outcomes, where certain variables dominate the analysis. To address this issue, standardization rescales the data to similar ranges, helping to avoid this problem and ensuring more reliable results.
