 Theory:  Curse of dimensionality : As the dimensions of a dataset increases, the available data becomes more sparse.  Singular value decomposition: It is a method that decomposses a matric into three different matrix representing the rotation and stretching factors of the matrix transformation.  Principle value Analysis:  The main objective of the PCA is to rigidly rotate the axes of t-dimensional axes to a new set of axes that have the properties:    Ordered such as the principal axes captures the highest variance, the 2nd axes capture the  2nd highest variance and so on.    Covariance among each pair of the principal axes is 0. (Decorrelation Property)  Principle Axes: The new set of axes.  Performing PCA with eigenvalue decomposition:    Compute data covariance matrix.   Perform Eigen value decomposition.   Reduce dimensions.  t-SNE:  The technique of t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is used to visualize high- dimensional data in two or three dimensions  It is non-linear approach to dimensionality reduction as opposed to PCA (which is linear).  It identifies patterns and relationships in the data and then represents those patterns in a lower- dimensional space to reduce the complexity of the data.  U-MAP:  UMAP constructs a graph representation of the data where:    Node: represents the data points.   Edges: represents similarities.  UMAP optimizes a low-dimensional representation of the data by minimizing a cost function that balances preservation of the local distances.
