Topic 4 Summary Dimensionality reduction Dimensionality In Data  Text data  Genomic data  Parkinsons disease case-control: 408,803 single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  SNPs))  Curse of dimensionality  more dimension = number of regions grows exponentially  distance concentration: distances between instances becomes more uniform  "When the dimensionality increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the  available data become sparse. This is really problematic since there isn’t enough data locally."  preserving information = hubs still present  Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  analysis of linear transformations  Video about Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues  What does matrices do? They rotate and stretch  Lambda is an eigenvalue || u is the eigenvector  Au = λu  Singular value decomposition (SVD)  method decomposing a matrix into 3 matrices  Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  uncorrelated axes are principal components / principal axes  dimensionality reduction method
