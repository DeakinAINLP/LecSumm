Curse of Dimensionality  When dimensionality of data increases, the volume of space between data points increases  so quickly that the data become sparse. E.g., 100 students have a 1-5 grading system for two classes, we will see each combination of grades 4 times on average because there are 25 possible combinations. If the students have a 1-5 grading system in 10 classes, many possible combinations will never be observed because there are 510 combinations possible.  As dimensionality of data increases, hubs of data are more likely to appear.  Dimensionality Reduction  Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of converting a set of data having vast  dimensions into data with fewer dimensions while still making sure that it conveys similar information concisely.  Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors  For a given square matrix A if a number ʎ and a vector u satisfy the condition Au = ʎu then ʎ  is called an eigenvalue and u is the corresponding eigenvector of A.  Principal Component Analysis  PCA is a dimensionality reduction method that reduces the dimensionality of large data sets by transforming variables into smaller ones while still retaining as much information as possible  Principal components are constructed in a way so that the first component accounts for the  largest possible variance in the data set.
