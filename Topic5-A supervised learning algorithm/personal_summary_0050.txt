In this topic we covered the Curse of dimensionality which refers to problems geting more diï¬ƒcult solve where there are instances of high dimensions [1]. An eigenvector is a non- zero vector that has scalar values and a an eigenvalue a scalar value that can be equal to zero [2]. There was a discussion on Singular value decomposition (SVD) which is a method of decomposing a matrix into three other matrices [3]. Principal component analysis is the process of applying axis regression to multivariate data. The data should be subject to multivariate normality and Outliers should be removed as they can skew the can results [4].
