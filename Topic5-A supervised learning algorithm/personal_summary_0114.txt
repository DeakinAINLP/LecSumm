1.  Solving the curse of dimensionality: The curse of dimensionality is a phenomenon  that occurs when the number of features or dimensions in a dataset increases, making it more difficult to analyze, visualize, and model. The high dimensionality can lead to issues such as overfitting, sparsity, and the need for large amounts of data. Solving the curse of dimensionality involves techniques such as feature selection, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction, which aim to reduce the number of features in the dataset while preserving important information.  2.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important concepts in linear algebra that play a crucial role in many data analysis techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA). Eigenvalues are scalar values that represent how much variance is captured by each eigenvector in a dataset, while eigenvectors are vectors that represent the direction in which the data varies the most.  3.  Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a widely used technique for  dimensionality reduction that aims to reduce the number of dimensions in a dataset while preserving the most important information. PCA works by identifying the directions of maximum variance in the data and projecting the data onto a lower- dimensional space defined by the principal components.  4.  Python programming: implementing PCA: Python offers several libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, that make it easy to implement PCA. The process involves loading the data, performing any necessary preprocessing, applying PCA to the data, and then analyzing and visualizing the results.  Dimensionality in Data: Dimensionality is the number of columns of data which is basically the attributes of data like name, age, sex and so on. While classification or clustering the data, we need to decide what all dimensionalities/columns we want to use to get meaning information.  1.  Sensor data: A single sensor can generate multiple data streams such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and so on. If you are collecting data from multiple sensors, then the dimensionality can quickly become very high.  2.  Audio data: Audio files can be represented as a sequence of samples, with each  sample representing the amplitude of the audio signal at a specific time. A single audio file can have a very high number of samples, leading to a high-dimensional feature space.  3.  Social media data: Social media platforms generate a vast amount of data, including  text, images, videos, and user interactions. Each post or interaction can be represented as a high-dimensional feature vector, leading to high-dimensional data.  4.  Financial data: Financial data such as stock prices, market indices, and economic indicators can have multiple dimensions. For instance, if you are analyzing stock prices, you may consider factors such as the stock's opening price, closing price, volume, volatility, and so on, leading to high-dimensional data.  5.  Medical data: Medical data can include various types of information, including  demographics, medical history, diagnoses, test results, and treatment plans. Each patient's data can be represented as a high-dimensional feature vector, leading to high- dimensional data.  CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY  The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience. The expression was coined by Richard E. Bellman when considering problems in dynamic programming.[1][2]  Dimensionally cursed phenomena occur in domains such as numerical analysis, sampling, combinatorics, machine learning, data mining and databases. The common theme of these problems is that when the dimensionality increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data become sparse.  the curse of dimensionality is a problem that arises when applying machine learning algorithms to high-dimensional data. as the number of dimensions increases, the available data becomes sparse, and the number of regions grows exponentially. this makes it difficult to analyze and organize the data, and can lead to poor performance of machine learning algorithms. dimensionality reduction techniques can help to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its structure and information content.  the concentration effect is an analysis of this problem, which states that the relative contrast between near and far neighbors diminishes as the dimensionality increases, making it difficult to discriminate between them. this makes clustering or knn algorithms meaningless in high dimensions, in the meantime, it can reduce the dimensionality of the data where possible to mitigate this problem and with the increase in dimensions, there are more chances for the occurrence of multicollinearity as well.  Generally, in the data gathering or extraction phase, we collect data from a lot of all possible  places and combine it, which results in a huge no. of features in our dataset. So, to solve real-  world business problems we generally require a lot of information and hence more features are  present in the data.  As we know that Avada Kedavra is an instantaneous kill curse and the only thing that can  save you from the curse is the resurrection stone, and so here in the muggle world, data  scientists have come up with a cure for the curse of dimensionality as well.  Dimensionality reduction is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its natural dimension or in simple words, it means reducing the dimensions of our data set. (Wikipedia reference).  Dimensionality reduction is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset. This is done to simplify the dataset and make it more     manageable for analysis. One common approach to dimensionality reduction is to use techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the most important features in the data and reduce the dataset to only those features. This can help to reduce noise in the data and improve the accuracy of machine learning models.  Real world examples of two variables with linear or noisy-linear relationships could include:  1.  Income and education level: these variables may have a linear relationship, where  higher education level tends to be associated with higher income. In this case, it may be reasonable to reduce dimensionality by selecting only one of these variables, depending on the specific research question.  2.  Age and years of work experience: these variables may also have a linear relationship,  where older individuals tend to have more years of work experience. Again, depending on the specific research question, it may be reasonable to reduce dimensionality by selecting only one of these variables.  3.  Sales and advertising spending: these variables may have a noisy-linear relationship, where higher levels of advertising spending may be associated with higher sales, but the relationship may not be perfectly linear. In this case, it may be useful to use dimensionality reduction techniques to identify the direction of maximum variance and project the data onto that direction to capture the most important information.  Eigenvalue  Eigenvalues are the special set of scalars associated with the system of linear equations. It is mostly used in matrix equations. ‘Eigen’ is a German word that means ‘proper’ or ‘characteristic’. Therefore, the term eigenvalue can be termed as characteristic value, characteristic root, proper values or latent roots as well. In simple words, the eigenvalue is a scalar that is used to transform the eigenvector. The basic equation is  The number or scalar value “λ” is an eigenvalue of A.  Ax = λx  In Mathematics, an eigenvector corresponds to the real non zero eigenvalues which point in the direction stretched by the transformation whereas eigenvalue is considered as a factor by which it is stretched. In case, if the eigenvalue is negative, the direction of the transformation is negative.  For every real matrix, there is an eigenvalue. Sometimes it might be complex. The existence of the eigenvalue for the complex matrices is equal to the fundamental theorem of algebra.  Eigenvectors are the vectors (non-zero) that do not change the direction when any linear transformation is applied. It changes by only a scalar factor. In a brief, we can say, if A is a linear transformation from a vector space V and x is a vector in V, which is not a zero vector, then v is an eigenvector of A if A(X) is a scalar multiple of x.      An Eigenspace of vector x consists of a set of all eigenvectors with the equivalent eigenvalue collectively with the zero vector. Though, the zero vector is not an eigenvector.  Let us say A is an “n × n” matrix and λ is an eigenvalue of matrix A, then x, a non-zero vector, is called as eigenvector if it satisfies the given below expression;  Ax = λx  x is an eigenvector of A corresponding to eigenvalue, λ.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are mathematical concepts used in the analysis of linear transformations. An eigenvalue is a number and an eigenvector is a vector that satisfy a certain condition for a given square matrix. For a matrix of size n, there are n eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  It is only possible to have a maximum of n non-zero eigenvalues for a matrix, and the number of non-zero eigenvalues is equal to the rank of the matrix. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a matrix can be used to understand its properties and behavior under transformations.  SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION  In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any matrix. It is related to the polar decomposition. The singular value decomposition of a matrix A is the factorization of A into the product of three matrices A = UDV T where the columns of U and V are orthonormal and the matrix D is diagonal with positive real entries. The SVD is useful in many tasks. Here we mention two examples. First, the rank of a matrix A can be read off from its SVD. This is useful when the elements of the matrix are real numbers that have been rounded to some finite precision.  SVD is used for dimensionality reduction, image compression, and data analysis. They may also provide examples of how to compute the SVD of a matrix and interpret its results, including the importance of the singular values and how they relate to the amount of variance in the data. The video may also discuss applications of SVD in various fields, such as machine learning, signal processing, and physics, decomposition is a powerful method in linear algebra that allows us to break down a matrix into three component matrices, which can be used for various applications such as image compression, dimensionality reduction, and data analysis. The diagonal elements of the middle matrix represent the singular values, which provide insight into the structure of the original matrix.  The preliminaries of PCA involve defining variance across each variable and covariances among variables. The covariance matrix is a matrix that contains variances of all variables on        the diagonal and co-variances among all pairs of variables in the off-diagonal entries. The goal of PCA is to take data points in n dimensions, which may be correlated, and summarise them by a new set of uncorrelated axes called principal components. These axes are linear combinations of the original n dimensions, and the first k components capture as much of the variation (or variance) among the data points as possible.  After calculating the covariance matrix of the original data, PCA proceeds to diagonalize it. This means finding a new set of axes that are orthogonal to each other and represent the directions of maximum variance in the data. The first principal component (PC) is chosen as the direction with the highest variance, and each subsequent PC is chosen to be orthogonal to the previous ones and to capture the remaining variance.  Formulation of PCA and deriving principal components  Principal Component Analysis is one of the standard methods used in dimensionality reduction. There are multiple posts detailing the code and implementation of PCA; in this post, however, we will look into how PCA is formulated and how we arrive at the PCA algorithm. While it is widely known that the Principal components are the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix; this post will explore why that is the case and how that solution is arrived at.  The Principal Component Analysis(PCA) problem can be formulated in two ways: Maximum Variance Formulation and Minimum Error Formulation. In the Maximum Variance Formulation, the goal is to find the orthogonal projection of the data into a lower dimensional linear space such that the variance of the projected data is maximised .( Aadhithya Sankar 2021).  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method for reducing the dimensionality of data by projecting it onto a new set of axes called principal components. These components are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data and are orthogonal to each other. By projecting the data onto the principal components, we can find the directions that capture the maximum variance in the data. PCA can be performed through eigenvaluedecomposition or by minimizing the projection error in the new dimensions. Both methods result in the same optimal solution, which is the top eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.         Implementation of PCA  (Aditya Dutt 2021). Principal Component Analysis or PCA is a commonly used dimensionality reduction method. It works by computing the principal components and performing a change of basis. It retains the data in the direction of maximum variance. The reduced features are uncorrelated with each other. These features can be used for unsupervised clustering and classification. To reduce dimensionality, autoencoder is another commonly used method. But, the latent space of the autoencoder is not necessarily uncorrelated. While PCA guarantees that all features are uncorrelated with each other. . Create random data: Create data by randomly drawing samples from a multivariate normal distribution. We will start with 2-dimensional data.  1.  Mean Centering/ Normalize data: Before PCA, we standardize/ normalize data.  Usually, normalization is done so that all features are at the same scale.  2.  Compute the covariance matrix: Now, we compute the covariance of all features  dimensions. Every covariance matrix is symmetric and positive semi-definite. It has  orthogonal eigen vectors.  3.  Compute eigen vectors of the covariance matrix: Now, we perform the eigen  decomposition of the covariance matrix and we will get eigen vectors and eigen  values.  4.  Compute the explained variance and select N components: The optimal way of  selecting the number of components is to compute the explained variance of each  feature.  5.  Transform Data using eigen vectors: Taken the dot product of our data with the eigen  vectors to get projections of our data in the direction of these eigen vectors geting the  projection along two perpendicular directions having the largest variances.  6.  Invert PCA and Reconstruct original data: We can also reconstruct the original data  by taking the dot product of transpose of eigen vectors with transformed data.  PCA can also be implemented through several methods, including Eigen Value Decomposition (EVD) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). When the number of data points is less than the number of dimensions, SVD can be used to reduce the computational cost. SVD can reduce the computations to the order of the smaller dimension or less, making it more efficient than EVD.  PCA can be implemented using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an alternative to Eigen Value Decomposition (EVD) when the number of data points is less than the number of dimensions. SVD is a matrix decomposition method that factorizes a matrix into three matrices:      Example of using PCA in facial image analysis  PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of face recognition problems. Each image in the dataset is represented by a vector of size 1024 pixels. The covariance matrix for the data is generated, and the principle eigen vectors that represent the data are found. The face image preservation of energy is calculated when a specific number of principle eigenvectors are used. Data is then projected back after preserving only a specific number of axes of variation using principle eigenvectors. The impact of different values of the number of preserved axes on final image quality is also discussed, and it is explained why selecting a smaller value for the number of preserved axes can be beneficial for a classifier.  Other dimensionality reduction techniques  1.  t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) 2.  LLE (Locally Linear Embedding) 3.  UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) 4.  Autoencoders 5.  Random Projection   Independent component analysis (ICA)  Independent Component Analysis is a signal processing method to separate independent sources linearly mixed in several sensors. For instance, when recording electroencephalograms (EEG) on the scalp, ICA can separate out artifacts embedded in the data (since they are usually independent of each other).  ICA is a powerful technique that can be used to identify underlying sources that contribute to a multivariate signal. It assumes that the observed signal is a linear combination of independent sources and aims to separate them. ICA can be used in various fields, including signal processing, image analysis, and neuroscience, to identify the underlying independent components of a signal. It is often used when the underlying sources are non-Gaussian, which makes it a valuable alternative to other dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA. ICA is important because it provides a way to understand the hidden structure of a data set, and it can be used in a variety of applications, such as signal processing, brain imaging, finance, and many other fields. In addition, ICA can help extract the most relevant information from data, providing valuable insights that would otherwise be lost in a sea of correlations. (Jonas Dieckmann 2015.)  Nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique:  T-SNE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique used to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. Unlike linear techniques, t-SNE uses complex mathematical techniques to identify and capture the underlying structure of the data. It finds patterns and relationships in the data and represents those patterns in a lower-dimensional space to reduce the complexity of the data. This allows for a better visualization of the data and can aid in identifying clusters or groups within the data  Nonlinear techniques are used when the data cannot be effectively represented by a linear model, or when the linear model is too simplistic to capture the underlying structure of the data. These techniques use more complex mathematical models, such as neural networks or kernel methods, to capture the nonlinear relationships between the data.  T-SNE is a popular nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that is widely used in data visualization tasks. It aims to preserve the pairwise similarity relationships between the data points in a lower-dimensional space.  It works by modeling the similarities between data points using a Gaussian distribution and then minimizing the divergence between the pairwise similarities in the high-dimensional space and those in the low-dimensional space. The resulting visualization can help reveal clusters and patterns in the data that may not be apparent in the original high-dimensional space.  T-SNE converts similarities between data point to joint probabilities and try to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint possibilities of the low- dimensional embedding and the high-dimensional data.  t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space, typically 2D or 3D.  t-SNE converts similarities between data points into joint probabilities that represent the likelihood of two data points being neighbors in both the high-dimensional and low- dimensional spaces. The similarities are computed using a Gaussian kernel function, and the joint probabilities are computed using the Student's t-distribution.  t-SNE minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the joint probabilities of the low-dimensional embedding and the high-dimensional data. This is done by iteratively adjusting the positions of the data points in the low-dimensional space to optimize the similarity between the joint probabilities of the two spaces.  The KL divergence is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions, in this case the joint probabilities of the high-dimensional data and the low-dimensional embedding. By minimizing the KL divergence, t-SNE aims to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the similarities and relationships between data points in the high-dimensional space.  t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique that converts similarities between data points into joint probabilities and aims to minimize the KL divergence between the joint probabilities of the low-dimensional embedding and the high-dimensional data. This helps to visualize high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space while preserving the relationships and similarities between data points.  In Python, you can use the scikit-learn library's TSNE class to perform t-SNE. The n_components parameter specifies the dimensionality of the low-dimensional space, and the random_state parameter controls the random initialization of the algorithm. After fitting the t-SNE model to the data, you can visualize the low-dimensional embedding using a scatter plot, for example, with matplotlib or plotly.
