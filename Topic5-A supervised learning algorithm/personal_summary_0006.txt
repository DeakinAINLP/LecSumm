Curse of dimensionality usually occurs when dealing with high dimensional data due to the lack of data in high dimensional spaces. The ability to overcome this curse is crucial especially in  fields  like  quantum  mechanics,  statistical  physics,  inverse  problems,  uncertainty quantifications, probability theory, and many other fields in science and engineering . One of  the  methods  to  eliminate  the  curse  of  dimensionality  is  to  reduce  the  overall  dimension without losing information. Determination of Eigen values and Eigen vector for a given matrix and singular value decomposition was discussed.  Principal component analysis a statistical technique  used  to  reduce  the  dimensionality  of  a  dataset  while  retaining  as  much  of  the variation  in  the  dataset  as  possible .  Independent  component  analysis  is  a  method  of separating a multivariate signal into independent, non-Gaussian components.
