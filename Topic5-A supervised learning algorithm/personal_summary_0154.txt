 This topic's lesson focused on the idea of data dimensionality, which states that as the number of dimensions rises, so do the number of regions, making the data sparse and less usable. As techniques for breaking down and isolaKng data, singular value decomposiKon (SVD) and independent component analysis (ICA) were introduced. There was also discussion of nonlinear techniques, which use more complex mathemaKcal methods to recognise and record the underlying structure of the data. In order to visualise high- dimensional data in lower-dimensional environments, the t-SNE (t-Distributed StochasKc Neighbor Embedding) methodology was introduced.
