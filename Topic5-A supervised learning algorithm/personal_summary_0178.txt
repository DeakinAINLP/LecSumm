 Main points summary  -  The Curse of Dimensionality. When dimensionality increases, the volume of the space increases and the data can become sparse. The Curse of Dimensionality can be solved with Dimensionality Reduction, which is decreasing the amount of dimensions without significantly altering the information from the data. -  Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. Prominently used in the analysis of linear  transformations.  -  Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a method of decomposing a matrix into  three other matrices. SVD is a component in Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  -  Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goal with PCA is to reduce the  dimensionality of the data set without losing important traits. The uncorrelated axes are called principal components. Face recognition problems is an example of an area where PCA is used. An alternative dimensionality reduction technique is Independent component analysis (ICA), which is a method of separating a multivariate signal into independent, non-Gaussian components.  -  Using PCA in Python.
