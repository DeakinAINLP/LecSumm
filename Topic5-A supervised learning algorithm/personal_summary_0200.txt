Dimensionality in Data High-dimensional data refers to data with a large number of variables or features, often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions. Some common types of high-dimensional data include:  1.  Images:  Image  data  can  be  represented  as  high-dimensional  arrays,  where  each  pixel  is  a feature or dimension.  2.  Text: Text data can be represented as high-dimensional vectors, where each word or n-gram  is a feature or dimension.  3.  Genomic  data:  Genomic  data  can  be  represented  as  high-dimensional  arrays,  where  each  gene or variant is a feature or dimension.  4.  Sensor  data:  Sensor  data  from  IoT  devices  or  other  sources  can  be  represented  as  high-  dimensional arrays, where each sensor reading is a feature or dimension.  5.  Financial  data:  Financial  data  can  be  represented  as  high-dimensional  vectors,  where  each  variable (such as price, volume, or volatility) is a feature or dimension.  6.  Audio data: Audio data can be represented as high-dimensional arrays or vectors, where each  sample or feature is a dimension.  Curse of Dimensionality  The curse of dimensionality is a term used to describe the difficulties and challenges that arise when working with high-dimensional data. As the number of features or dimensions in a dataset increases, the amount of data required to effectively model or analyse it grows exponentially.  This can lead to a variety of problems, including overfitting, increased computational complexity, and decreased interpretability. Specifically, as the dimensionality of a dataset increases:    The amount of data required to avoid overfitting increases exponentially, making it difficult to  obtain accurate estimates of the relationships between variables.    The computational complexity of analysing the data increases exponentially, making it difficult  to perform computations in a reasonable amount of time.    The  sparsity  of  the  data  increases,  making  it  difficult  to  find  meaningful  patterns  or  relationships.    The interpretability of the data decreases, as it becomes difficult to visualize or understand  high-dimensional data.  Distance Concentration Another facet of the curse of dimensionality is ‘Distance Concentration’. Distance concentration refers to the problem of all the pairwise distances between different samples/points in the space converging to the same value as the dimensionality of the data increases. Several machine learning models such as  clustering  or  nearest  neighbours’  methods  use  distance-based  metrics  to  identify  similarities  or proximity of the samples. Due to distance concentration, the concept of proximity or similarity of the samples may not be qualitatively relevant in higher dimensions.  A density plot of the distances between the points and the probability of frequency of occurrence of the distance is created for different dimensions. For one-dimensional torus, we see that the density is approximately  uniform.  As  the  number  of  dimensions  increases,  we  see  that  the  spread  of  the frequency plot decreases indicating that distances between different samples or points tend towards a single value as the dimension increases (Great Learning Team, 2022).  So it reduces the utility of the measure to discriminate between near and far neighbours. Relative contrast between near and far neighbours diminishes as the dimensionality increases.
