topic 3 summary  -measuring distances, some of these methods includes clustering algorithms, k-nearest-nieighbor, SVM, data visualization and information retrieval  Types of distance measurements include, Euclidean distance, cosine distance, mahalanobis distance, cityblock/ Manhattan distance, minkoski distance, jaccard distance.  Clustering algorithms- putting data point into groups using similarities and differences of features.  Used to discover, explore and gather information.  Kmeans, k represents the centre point of clusters, it searches for the best centroid through assigning data point to clusters based on the current defined centroids or choosing centroid based on current assignments of data points.  Evaluation methods of clustering, consist of two categories, external assessment and internal assessment.  Internal clusters- ground truth, gold standard  External clusters silhouette coefficient, dunn index  Rand index- measures the similarities of two data clusters  Purity- a way to measure the quality of the clustering methods.  Mutual information, measure the agreement between two clustering assignments  Silhouette coefficient measure how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters  Clustering with kmean++ an algorithm for choosing the initial clusters centre values or centroids
