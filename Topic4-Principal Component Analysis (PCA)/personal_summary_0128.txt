 Ans: ➢  Different ways of unsupervised Machine learning but discussed the  clustering way which is generally used to label or collect the unlabeled data.  ➢  Distance metrices are helpful in measuring the distances between  two datasets.  ➢  Types of distance computing are Euclidean distance, which is a  simple straight line between two pointers.  . Cosine Distance is used to calculate distance between two vectors. . Mahalanobis distance is usable when we are require to compute the multivariate space. . Manhattan distance this is also usable for computing vectors however, in this one the large difference is sparged in single dimension.  . Minkowski distance, calculates the distance between two points in a normed vector. . Jaccard distance, helps in measuring the diversity among two sets.  All of them were explained with help of examples.  ➢  Clustering & the algorithms, as how they help in structuring or  labelling the scattered data.  ➢  KMeans algorithm is one of the renowned method which calculates the data points by fixing the centroids & finding the closest one.  ➢  Evaluation of clustering involves computation of  Purity,  precisioning, accuracy, rand index , silhouette coefficient etc. ➢  Kmeans generally uses elbow method to figure out the number of clusters but it also has limitations, which are somehow covered by Kmeans ++, an enhanced version of Kmeans .   ➢  Different types of clustering Algorithms, Kmeans, Hierarichal,  DBSCAN, Shape-based etc.  ➢  Implementing Kmeans algo in python , along with the evaluation of  it’s different performance metrices.
