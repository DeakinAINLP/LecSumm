Unsupervised Machine Learning  Unsupervised machine learning, particularly clustering and dimensionality reduction.  Clustering is used to find patterns in unlabelled data, while dimensionality reduction is  used when the number of features becomes too large to manage. The programming part of  the unit will cover how to use Python packages for creating unsupervised models, reducing  dimensionality, and visualizing high dimensional data. By the end of the unit, learners  should be able to apply suitable clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to  perform unsupervised learning of data in a real-world scenario.  Measuring Distances  This text discusses the importance of distance metrics in machine learning algorithms,  which are used to measure similarity or distance between different data points. Distance  metrics satisfy three properties: distance with itself is zero, distance is non-negative and  symmetric between two instances, and distance measures follow triangular inequality. The  text presents two examples of machine learning algorithms that utilize distance metrics:  nearest neighbor classification and image retrieval. Then, different types of distance  measurements are introduced, such as Euclidean distance, cosine distance, Mahalanobis  distance, Cityblock/Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, and Jaccard distance. The  text provides equations and examples for each of these distance measures.  Different Distance Metrics  1.  Euclidean distance: It is the most commonly used distance metric, which calculates the  straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. It is often used in clustering  algorithms, such as K-Means.  2.  Cosine distance: It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a high-  dimensional space. It is used in text mining applications, where documents are represented  as vectors of words.  3.  Mahalanobis distance: It takes into account the correlation between different variables and  is used when the data is not isotropic (i.e., its shape is elongated in one or more directions).  It is often used in outlier detection.    4.  Cityblock/Manhattan distance: It calculates the distance between two points by summing  the absolute differences of their coordinates. It is often used in image processing and  computer vision applications.  5.  Minkowski distance: It is a generalized version of Euclidean and Manhattan distances,  where a parameter p determines the degree of the distance metric. When p=1, it becomes  Manhattan distance, and when p=2, it becomes Euclidean distance.  6.  Jaccard distance: It is used to measure the similarity between two sets. It is calculated as  the ratio of the size of the intersection of the two sets to the size of their union. It is often  used in recommendation systems and information retrieval.  Clustering and its Applications  Clustering is a machine learning technique that groups data points into clusters based on  similarity and difference of features. It is particularly useful in unsupervised learning,  where the data is unclassified and has no known targets, but can also be used in supervised  learning. The goal of clustering algorithms is to group data objects with similar properties  together, discover interesting clusters in the data, and find a valid organization of the data.  The key to successful clustering is to define a distance metric between objects, an objective  function that minimizes intra-distance (distance between points in the same cluster) and  maximizes inter-distance (distance between points from different clusters), and an  algorithm to optimize the objective function. Clustering has applications in various fields  such as image segmentation, market segmentation, anomaly detection, and more.  How Kmeans Works  K-means is a popular clustering algorithm in machine learning that is simple and fast. In  this algorithm, "k" represents the center points of clusters. The algorithm starts with these  centroids and then measures each data point to find its closest centroid. K-means stores  centroids for defining clusters, and a point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is  closer to that cluster's centroid than any other centroid. K-means searches for the best     centroids by alternating between two methods: assigning data points to clusters based on  the current defined centroids and choosing centroids based on the current assignment of  data points to clusters. Step 1 and 2 repeat until a useful grouping of data points is found.  Evaluation of Clustering  Evaluation of clustering is an important step in the clustering process. It helps us to  determine if the clusters are useful and if the algorithm is performing well. Purity is a  simple external evaluation metric that measures the percentage of correctly classified data  points in the clusters. However, purity has its limitations and may not be sufficient in all  cases. That's why other external and internal evaluation metrics, such as the Rand index,  Silhouette coefficient, and Dunn index, are used to evaluate clustering performance. The  Rand index measures the similarity between two data clusters, the predicted clusters, and  the ground truth clusters.  It is important to choose the appropriate evaluation metric based on the nature of the data,  the clustering algorithm used, and the goals of the clustering process.  The evaluation metrics you've mentioned (Adjusted Rand Index, Purity, Mutual  Information, and Silhouette Coefficient) are all used to evaluate the performance of  clustering algorithms. The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) measures the similarity between  two clusterings, taking into account chance agreement. ARI ranges from -1 to 1, where 1  indicates perfect agreement, 0 indicates agreement by chance, and negative values indicate  disagreement. Purity is a measure of how well the clusters match the true labels of the data.  It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that each cluster contains only instances from one  class. Mutual Information (MI) measures how much information one clustering provides  about another clustering. MI ranges from 0 to infinity, where higher values indicate greater  similarity between the clusterings. The Silhouette Coefficient measures how well each  instance fits into its own cluster, compared to other clusters. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1  indicates that the instance is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to other  clusters, and -1 indicates the opposite. A value of 0 indicates that the instance is equally  similar to its own cluster and other clusters.   Limitations of Kmeans  Kmeans clustering has several limitations, including:  1.  Random initialization can result in different clusters each time.  2.  The number of clusters must be specified beforehand.  3.  Kmeans cannot find clusters of arbitrary shapes.  4.  Kmeans cannot detect noisy data points.  To address these limitations, Kmeans++ initialization can be used, and the Elbow method  can be employed to determine the appropriate number of clusters. The Elbow method  involves running the Kmeans algorithm for a range of cluster numbers and calculating the  sum of squared errors (SSE) for each. The optimal number of clusters is chosen based on  the "elbow" point in the resulting SSE vs. cluster number plot. However, in some cases, it  may be challenging to discern an elbow shape in the plot.  Kmeans with Kmeans++  Kmeans++ has a theoretical guarantee that the solution found by the algorithm is at most  times the optimal solution, where is the number of clusters. This means that as the number  of clusters increases, the gap between the solution found by Kmeans++ and the optimal  solution decreases. This is a significant improvement over the random initialisation  approach used by the standard Kmeans algorithm.  The main learning outcome of using Kmeans with Kmeans++ is that it provides a better  way to choose the initial cluster center values or centroids, which results in more accurate  and consistent clustering. By using Kmeans++, we can reduce the chances of getting  different clusters each time and improve the performance of the Kmeans algorithm.  Kmeans++ also provides a theoretical guarantee on convergence, which ensures that the  algorithm gets closer to the best solution with each iteration. Overall, Kmeans++ can help  to overcome some of the limitations of the simple Kmeans algorithm, such as the need to  supply the number of clusters beforehand and the difficulty in finding clusters of arbitrary  shapes.   Other Clustering Algorithms  There are several other clustering algorithms in addition to Kmeans that can be used for  different purposes. Hierarchical clustering methods, such as agglomerative and divisive  clustering, create clusters in a predetermined order and produce a dendrogram. DBSCAN is  a density-based clustering algorithm that clusters data points based on a given distance and  minimum number of points, and can identify noise points. Shape-based clustering methods,  such as VAT and iVAT, are visualization techniques that can help to identify the clustering  structure of data and determine the optimal number of clusters. Learning about these  different clustering algorithms can help data analysts to select the appropriate algorithm for  their specific problem and data.  There are also other clustering algorithms worth mentioning, such as:  1.  Spectral clustering: this method uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the similarity  matrix to cluster the data. It is especially useful for non-convex clusters and can handle  high-dimensional data.  2.  Fuzzy clustering: unlike K-means, which assigns a point to a single cluster, fuzzy  clustering assigns each point a membership value for each cluster. This is useful when a  point may belong to multiple clusters to different degrees.  3.  Gaussian mixture models: this method models each cluster as a Gaussian distribution and  estimates the parameters of these distributions to fit the data. It is especially useful when  the data is not easily separable.  4.  Affinity propagation: this method does not require the number of clusters to be specified  beforehand. Instead, it iteratively sends messages between data points to determine the  number and location of clusters.  Each clustering algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of  algorithm depends on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis.  Kmeans Clustering with Python  The K-means clustering is a method to group unlabelled data into clusters with similar  characteristics. The Scikit learn package in Python provides an implementation of the  KMeans algorithm. The KMeans algorithm requires a predefined number of clusters,  which can be determined using the elbow method. The elbow method involves plotting the  distortion (distance) values for different K values and selecting the K value at the "elbow"  of the plot, where the change in distortion values starts to level off. The KElbowVisualizer  from the yellowbrick package can be used to visualize the elbow plot. The digitData0.csv  and digitData1.csv files can be loaded and merged to create a feature set for clustering. The  target column can be used as a ground truth for evaluating the clustering results.  KMeans clustering using Python and Scikit learn.  The code loads two CSV files containing digit data (digitdata0.csv and digitData1.csv)  using pandas library. Then, it merges the two data frames and renames the columns.  Next, to define the number of clusters (K), the elbow method is used. The elbow method  helps in determining the optimal number of clusters by plotting the number of clusters  against the within-cluster sum of squares (also known as inertia) and selecting the "elbow"  point where the change in inertia starts to decrease. This is done using the  KElbowVisualizer module from the yellowbrick library.  After determining the optimal number of clusters, the KMeans algorithm is applied to the  data using Scikit learn's KMeans module. The algorithm works by randomly initializing the  cluster centers and then iteratively updating them until convergence. Finally, the cluster  labels are assigned to each data point and the results are visualized using various  techniques such as scatter plots or heat maps.  Evaluating Performance of Kmeans Clustering  KMeans is a method for finding clusters and cluster centers in a set of unlabelled data. The  following steps summarize how to implement KMeans clustering using the Scikit learn  package in Python:  1.  Load CSV file for KMeans clustering. Two CSV files digitdata0.csv and digitData1.csv  were used in this example.     2.  Merge two data frames and rename the header names.  3.  Define the number of clusters, K using the elbow method. The elbow method shows the  optimum k value from a range of values using distance metrics.  4.  Train and test KMeans clustering using the KMeans() function from the Scikit learn  package.  5.  Evaluate the performance of KMeans clustering using different performance metrics such  as purity, mutual information, silhouette coefficient, f1, recall, accuracy, and precision.  The purity of KMeans in this example is 0.202, which is a relatively low score indicating  that the clusters are not very pure. However, it is important to note that the performance of  KMeans clustering may vary depending on the data used and the value of K selected.  In addition to purity, there are other performance metrics that can be used to evaluate the  performance of KMeans clustering.  Mutual Information (MI) is a measure that evaluates the agreement between two  clusterings, taking into account chance agreement. It ranges from 0 (no mutual  information) to 1 (perfect agreement).  Silhouette Coefficient measures how well a data point fits into its assigned cluster and how  poorly it fits into other clusters. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates that the point is  well-matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.  F1, Recall, Accuracy, and Precision are metrics that are commonly used in classification  tasks, but they can also be used in clustering. They are based on the concept of true  positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.  Here's an example of how to calculate these performance metrics for KMeans clustering:   DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering  KMeans, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering.  The purity score for KMeans was 0.202, which indicates that the clustering was not very  accurate.  The purity score for DBSCAN was 0.519, which is better than KMeans.  The purity score for hierarchical clustering was also 0.519, which is the same as DBSCAN.  The purity is just one metric for evaluating clustering algorithms. Depending on the nature  of your data, other metrics such as silhouette coefficient, homogeneity, and completeness  may also be useful.  The DBSCAN algorithm is a density-based clustering algorithm that can find clusters of  varying densities and is particularly useful when dealing with data that has noise. The  model works by finding core samples of high density and expanding clusters from them.  The performance of the DBSCAN model can be evaluated using the purity score.  The Hierarchical clustering algorithm is another clustering algorithm that creates a  hierarchy of clusters, also known as a dendrogram, based on the similarity of data points.  The model can be evaluated using the purity score.  In the provided code snippets, both the DBSCAN and Hierarchical clustering algorithms  are applied to the dataset. The purity score for both models is the same, 0.519. Therefore, it  can be concluded that the performance of both models is comparable on this dataset.
