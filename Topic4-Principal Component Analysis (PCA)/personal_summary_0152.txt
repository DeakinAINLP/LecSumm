 A machine learning technique called clustering involves pu_ng data points into groups based on how similar they are. Finding paSerns in the data and highlighIng similariIes and diﬀerences between data points are the main objecIves. A common clustering algorithm used to divide data points into a predetermined number of clusters is KMeans. IteraIvely assigning data points to the nearest cluster centre and updaIng the centre of each cluster depending on the newly assigned data points is how the method operates. IniIally, a set of random points are chosen as cluster centres. In comparison to the original KMeans algorithm, KMeans++ uses a more sophisIcated method of choosing iniIal cluster centres, producing results that are more accurate and reliable. The Elbow Method is a method for ﬁguring out how many clusters in KMeans clustering are best. It entails choosing the "elbow" point, which is the point where the rate of decline in the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) starts to level out, by graphing the WCSS against the quanIty of clusters employed.  Distance, which deﬁnes how similar or unlike two data points are to one another, is a crucial factor in clustering. Several distance metrics, including Euclidean distance, ManhaSan distance, and cosine similarity, are employed in clustering. The data being clustered and the issue being solved inﬂuence the choice of distance metric.
