 This topic we discussed unsupervised learning, focusing on clustering techniques.  The clustering techniques discussed explicitly in the course material were KMeans and DBSCAN.  The KMeans algorithm works by assigning a centroid randomly and iterating through the data points to determine the best location for that centroid. The number of clusters is determined by the number of centroids, k. When assigning a point to a new cluster itâ€™s distance is measured from the nearest centroid and it is placed into that cluster.  The DBSCAN method works by measuring the density of a group of data points and the empty space between groups of data points to determine the amount of clusters. This method is slower than the KMeans algorithm however may be better at determining clusters due to the KMeans algorithm assigning all data points to a cluster even where the number of clusters does not fit the data.
