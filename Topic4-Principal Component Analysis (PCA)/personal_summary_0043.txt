Fundamental concepts of distance measures, i.e. must satisfy the triangle inequality, must be >= 0, and distance to self must be 0. Some basic distance metrics, Manhattan (L1) euclidean (L2), cosine, Mahalanobis, Minkowski & Jaccard. All commonly used and useful in real world applications. Some basic concepts of performance i.e. recall, precision & accuracy. Some means for evaluating performance i.e. Rand index, Mutual Information & the silhouette coefficient.   The most common clustering algorithm: K-Means, how it works, some of it’s limitations i.e.  picking the number of clusters and starting points.   K-Means++ which is now just standard (along with a few other variations).  Also covered was the “elbow method” which may be useful for a data scientist doing exploration, but it’s useless for an automated production system. Some examples of using SKLearn to perform Kmeans, DBSCAN and Agglomerative clustering.
