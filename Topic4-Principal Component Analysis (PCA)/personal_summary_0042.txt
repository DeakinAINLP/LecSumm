In this topic of unit learnings we learns about the unsupervised machine learning. We looked in two forms of unsupervised learning which ate clustering and dimensionality reduction. For that we learn about measuring distances. Measuring similarity or distances between different data points in fundamental to many machine learning algorithms. These algorithms are used both unsupervised and supervised learning problems. distance metrics is used to measure the distance between the points. Distance measure satisfy three major distance properties which help in clustering. distance metrics have multiple types like euclidean distance , cosine distance, mahalanobis distance , city-block distance and jaccard distance etc. the major this we learned this topic was clustering and type of methods we use in clustering to understand the data better. Clustering put data points into groups like our brain make groups of multiple objects gathered in same place and make a pattern out of it. Same this clustering dies with datasets. It gather data and make patterns out of it so it is better to understand. The grouping is based of similarities and differences of features. We could chose only specific features to find similarities and differences could find the minimum and maximum inter-distance and intra-distance of clusters. The most popular algorithms for clustering in machine learning we learnt about is Kmeans. K means worked with unlabelled data to get us the a simple means value out of these clusters. the better knowledge about out topic leacture learnings we To get practiced these concepts in workshop and turned out knowledge into code form using python.
