Summary Over the course of this unit we covered Kmeans clustering of a data set and diﬀerent ways to calculate distance between two diﬀerent points on an n-dimensional graph including Cosine, Euclidian, Mahalanobis Manha(ttan, Minkowski and Jaccard distances.  Kmeans is an algorithm designed to ﬁnd the center points of clusters of data. The base kmeans algorithm works by assigning data points to centroids then creating new centroids based on the clusters repeat until satisﬁed with the grouping. Kmeans++ is an adaptation of Kmeans where instead of assigning all centroids it randomly assigns one and then assigns all other centroids based on the ﬁrst one. Kmeans++ can be but is not guaranteed to perform be(tter  The diﬀerent distance measuring types change exactly how clusters will be formed. For example, Euclidian distance is the simplest form of distance in that it is just distance as the crow ﬂies while Jaccard distance measures how dissimilar a speciﬁc piece of data is from any other.  Reﬂection Over the course of this topic I have learnt how Kmeans and distance measures work to a degree I am having a bit of a time trying to wrap my head around how to do all of this in python.
