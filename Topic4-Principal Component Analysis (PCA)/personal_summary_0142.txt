Our focus for this topic was unsupervised learning, and in particular clustering, which is a type of unsupervised learning. The process of clustering is the grouping of similar data points together on the basis of certain characteristics that make them similar. We have discussed different types of distance measurements, such as Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev, Minkowski, Mahalanobis, and Jaccard distances, which are used to measure the similarity between the data points. There is also a detailed study of the K-Mean algorithm, which is one of the most popular algorithms for clustering data.  In addition, a discussion was conducted regarding the evaluation process of clustering, which included both external and internal assessment methods. There is still a need to explore other clustering techniques such as hierarchical-based clustering, density-based clustering, and shape-based clustering. Overall, these topics provide a solid understanding of unsupervised learning and the different methods used in clustering to group data points with similar characteristics.
