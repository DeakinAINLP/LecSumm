 This topicâ€™s material is the first part of a two-topic series covering unsupervised machine learning. For this topic, clustering was covered. Clustering is a technique that can be used to find patterns in larger datasets where data may be unlabelled. The unit learning material1 provided an analogy of clustering using the human brain as an example. There are several more specific goals of clustering: grouping unlabelled data with similar properties, discovering interesting or anomalous clusters in data, and finding some sort of valid or useful organisation of data. Clustering can achieve this by finding distances within and between clusters.  Including K-means clustering, there are several other algorithm categories for clustering including hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and shape-based clustering; these categories contain further algorithms. K-means is known to be one of the more popular clustering methods in machine learning. Several methods exist for evaluating the results of clustering methods; listing them would be exhaustive.
