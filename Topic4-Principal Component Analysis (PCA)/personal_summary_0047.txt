 This topic, I learned about machine learning and how it enables machines to learn from data without explicit programming, using statistical and computational techniques. I discovered that to use machine learning algorithms effectively, a good grasp of statistics, data wrangling, data representation, and data exploration is essential. I learned basic statistical concepts like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation and how probability distributions like Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Poisson are commonly used in machine learning. Data wrangling, which involves cleaning and transforming raw data into an analysable format, is an essential step in machine learning, including handling missing data, removing outliers, and transforming variables.  I also learned that images and text could be used as data for machine learning and the techniques for preprocessing images and representing text data like bag-of-words and word embeddings. Feature extraction, the process of selecting and transforming relevant features from data for use in machine learning algorithms, is also covered. I discovered that data and signals are two different types of information that can be used in machine learning and how encoding and distribution are essential aspects of preparing data for use in machine learning, which involves techniques like one- hot encoding and probability distributions. Scaling and normalisation are crucial steps in data preparation, and I also learned about techniques for data wrangling using Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy.  In addition, I learned how statistics are essential in data science, enabling scientists to test hypotheses and analyse regression and techniques for exploring and visualising data, such as scatter plots, histograms, and heat maps. Lastly, I learned the techniques for preparing data for machine learning algorithms, including min-max scaling, z-score normalisation, label encoding, and one-hot encoding. In conclusion, I realised that machine learning is a complex field requiring a deep understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques. By mastering these, we can gain a solid foundation for effectively working with machine learning algorithms and making data-driven decisions.
