 The major topics that were covered during topic 3 includes unsupervised learning, various distance metrics, Kmeans, Kmeans++, and other clustering algorithms including DBSCAN. Finally, hierarchical clustering and Kmeans clustering using Python, and evaluation of performance of Kmeans clustering was discussed. The primary reference source was the unit site contents along with the external video links and articles provided.  The initial phase dealt with the basics of unsupervised machine learning during which two major aspects of it, namely clustering and dimensionality reduction were learnt. Then, I gained a solid understanding about measuring distances between different data points, i.e. distance metrics - types of distance measurements(Euclidean distance, Cosine distance, Mahalanobis distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, Chebyshev distance, and Jaccard distance). Next, I gained knowledge on Clustering, its applications, and an overview of clustering algorithms. Then, I gained an idea about how Kmeans algorithm work, evaluation of clustering both external and internal assessment. This was followed by the topic of Rand index which is a measure of the similarity between two data clusters, Purity which is a way of quality measurement in clustering methods, Mutual information, and Silhouette Coefficient. Later in the topic, I learnt the limitations of Kmeans and clustering with Kmeans++ algorithm. Towards the end, I acquired knowledge regarding some other clustering algorithms such as Hierarchical clustering(Agglomerative(bottom-up) & Divisive clustering(top-down)), DBSCAN(density based), Shape-based clustering. The final topic was regarding the implementation of Kmeans clustering, evaluating performance of Kmeans clustering, DBSCAN & hierarchical clustering using python.
