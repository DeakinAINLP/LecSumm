In this topic we cover unsupervised machine learning with concepts such as Clustering, Dimensionality reduction, Distance metrics, Euclidean distance, Cosine distance, Kmeans and Kmeans++.  TASK REFLECTION  I will use the information in covered in this topic to implement the Silhouete Coeﬃcient to ﬁnd the optimum k values and Create clusters using Kmeans and Kmeans++ algorithms with optimal k value , this can be used to form reports on  performances using diﬀerent evaluation metrics.
