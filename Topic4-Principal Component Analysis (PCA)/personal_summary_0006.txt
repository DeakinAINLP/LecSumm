By  partitioning  the  objects  into  sets  (known  as  clusters)  based  on  their  similarities,  cluster analysis  offers  a  means  to  gain  understanding  of  the  data  and  the  relationships  among  its constituent  elements  [1].  Essentially,  objects  within  a  given  cluster  tend  to  exhibit  greater similarities to each other than to objects located in separate clusters [2]. Distance measurement is and important aspect of cluster analysis. There are different types of distance measurement like Euclidean distance, Cosine distance, Mahalanobis distance, Cityblock/Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance and Jaccard distance. Cluster algorithms has two goals, minimise intra-distance  within  similar  cluster  points  and  maximise  inter-distance  between  points  from different clusters. It involves defining a distance metric between object, followed by defining an objective function that gets to our clustering goal and finally devise an algorithm to optimise the objective function. k-means  is  a  popular  clustering  algorithm  used  in  machine  learning.  In  this  algorithm  k centroids are used to define the cluster either choosing centroids based on assigned data points or assigning data points based on already chosen centroids. Purity is an evaluation technique for  clustering  which  is  measured  by  dividing  number  of  correctly  assigned  points  to  total number  of  points  in  a  set.  There  are  also  other  evaluations  like  mutual  information  and Silhouette coefficient. Elbow method can be used to determine the ideal number of clusters. There are also other clustering algorithms which can be broadly classified as Partition based, Hierarchical based, Density based, Grid based and Model based clustering.
