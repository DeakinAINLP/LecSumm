  Distance/Similarity measures  o  Crucial in data classification  ▪  Types if distance metrics a.  Euclidean distance b.  Cosine distance c.  Mahalanobis distance d.  Cityblock/Manhattan distance e.  Minkowski distance f.  Jaccard distance    Clustering of data: o  K-means -  ▪  Evaluating cluster scores through: Silhouette coefficient, Rand Index, Purity Scores, mutual information, f1, recall, accuracy, precision  o  Limitations of Kmeans. Using the elbow method on python to find  optimial number of Clusters in data set  o  Kmeans ++ to find cluster centroid o  Intra-Distance = Measurement of difference between data points of  the same classification (clusters)  o  Inter-distance = measurement of difference between different  classifications (clusters)    Other clustering methods on data sets that could be vulnerable to noise  o  DBSCN o  Shape based o  Heirarchial  ▪  Agglomerative Clustering ▪  Divisive Clustering
