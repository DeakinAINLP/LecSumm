In topic 3, we focused more on clustering and kmeans. The three main points for this topic were learning about several distance and similarity measures, the concept of clustering itself, and the different approaches of clustering used to solve real world problems. I learned more about some formulas I had covered in the past, such as the euclidean distance, and learned about some new ones such as the jaccard and manhattan distances. I learned how to implement these formulae, and when to apply them to a given problem. I had covered clustering already last year and so was very familiar with the concept of it and kmeans. What was new to me however was applying kmeans and kmeans++ as well as the different approaches used in order to find the optimal k value. I learned how to use the silhouette and elbow methods, and learned how to compare the different results between the data of the clusters and the significance of that data.
