In topic 3, I learnt the concept of clustering in detail. Clustering is used for unsupervised learning. The main concept that I covered were distance metrics,  Distance measurement is a fundamental concept in machine learning, as it allows us to quantify the similarity or dissimilarity between various data points. This is important in various applications such as clustering or classification. There are several dictance measures commonly used in machine learning which are:    Euclidean distance: this is the most common distance measure used in ML. it  calculate the distance between two points in n-dimensional space as the square root of the sum of the squared difference between their corresponding coordinated.    Manhattan distance:  it calculates the distance between two points by summing up  the absolute difference between their corresponding coordinates.    Cosine distance: it measure the similarity between two vectors by calculating the  cosine of the angle between them.    Chebyshev distance:   Jaccard distance:  it measure the dissimilarity between two sets and is calculated as  the ratio of the size of the intersection of the sets to the size of their union.  Other than this I learnt about the clustering algorithms, which could be defined as measuring the intra-distance or minimize intra- distance, which the distanvce between the data points within a cluster. On the other hand, the distance between the points from different clusters is known as inter-distance or Maximise inter-distance.  The most effective and easy algorithm is kmean.whereas there are other algorithms as well which  are:    Hierarchical clustering   DBSCAN   Shape-based clustering
