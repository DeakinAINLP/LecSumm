Measuring similarity or distances between data points is used in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.  Clustering puts data points into groups (clusters). There are many clustering algorithms, but this topic we focused on K-means, which is a simple and fast popular clustering algorithm, itâ€™s used for unsupervised machine learning.  There are some performance metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of K-means clustering, including purity, mutual information, silhouette coefficient, f1, recall, accuracy and precision.
