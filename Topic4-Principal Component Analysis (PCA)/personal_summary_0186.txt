It is used to cluster unlabelled data   Distance metrics is used in machine learning  Types of metrics include euclidean, cosine, mahalanobis and manhattan distance  K means is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm   Evaluations metrics are used to evaluate the clusters  These metrics are rand index, silhouette coefficient and purity  K means++ is another algorithm and is used to choose the initial centre values   Reflection: I learned a lot in this topic. It refreshed some of my knowledge on K means and also gave me knew knowledge such as the various distance metrics and evaluation methods for clusters. I also learned about K means++ and how it can be implemented in python.
