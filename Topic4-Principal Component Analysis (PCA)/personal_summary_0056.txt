 In this topic we learn about the unsupervised machine Learning techniques in detail     We start of with the Clustering tecnique and one such technique in clustering is the K-Means  Clustering technique.    We also learn about Measuring the distances between points such as the Euclidean Distance.   We aso get to learn about DBscan and Hierarical Clustering techniques.  EXPLANATION FOR PROBLEM SOLVINGS:   We start by loading the dataset digitData2.csv. we follow it up by finding the labels and feature extraction.    Using the Silhouette Coefficient we find out the optimum value and also plot them   We then apply the Kmeans clustering for over 50 times and find out the optimumvalues   We aso apply the DBscan and find optimum eps and optimum min_samples and we conclude by  finding the difference between the two solutions.
