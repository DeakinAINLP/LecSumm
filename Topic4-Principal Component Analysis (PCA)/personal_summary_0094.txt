This topic we were introduced to clustering algorithms. Focusing specifically on Kmeans.  Distance metrics – Distance is used as metric when determining differences/similarities between data points.  Clustering algorithms – Puts datapoints into groups. A form of unsupervised learning that can organise data objects by grouping them with based on similar features.  Kmeans – Most popular clustering algorithm. K represents the number of clusters.    Start with random guess for centroids.   For each point, find its closest centroid.   Update centroids.   Loop until converging  Purity – An evaluation method of clustering. Measures the purity for all clusters in terms of class labels of the data.  Elbow method – A method for determining the ideal amount of clusters for the kmeans algorithm.
