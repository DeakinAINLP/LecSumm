 In this topic, we learned about clustering which is one of the unsupervised learning.  1)  Measuring distances  Distance metrics: Being used in both supervised and unsupervised learning, it determines how close or far apart two data points are from each other, which helps to identify patterns in the data.  Some of the examples are:    K-Nearest-Neighbor: As easy to implement, KNN is used for classification and regression   Support Vector Machines (SVM): As an supervised learning model, it performs classification  and regression of data groups. It works effectively in high dimensional space    data visualization: Uses visual aids such as graphs, charts to present trends   information retrieval: It finds relevant information including documents, images, etc and it can be done by algorithm when it comes to searching a large amount of data ranking: Used in supervised learning, it sorts out data in relevant order    2)  Examples of different distance metrics   Euclidean distance: It finds the distance between two points to measure how similar two  points are    Cosine distance: It measures the cosine of the angle between two points to find similarity   Mahalanobis distance: The example of Mahalanobis includes finding multivariate outliers   Cityblock/Manhattan distance: It is measured by the distance x plus the distance in y   Minkowski distance: It is used to find the similarity of the size   Jaccard distance: It is used to determine dissimilarity of samples  3)  Clustering  By grouping similar datasets into clusters, it discovers patterns and structures in the data based on similarities from raw data. As an unsupervised learning, it doesnâ€™t require labelling so is widely used in anomaly detection, pattern recognition and medical industry, marketing, etc.  -How to evaluate :  4)  K-means clustering  It finds the groups in the data our of unlabelled or undefined dataset via the variable K. It is useful algorithm, however, in terms of processing various sizes and density, it may have problem  5)  Other clustering algorithms   Hierarchical clustering: HCA develops a tree form called dendrogram.   DBSCAN (density based): It is useful when it comes to grouping similar data points   Shape-based  Clustering : Instead of distance, data will be grouped together based on the  similarity in shape or structure
