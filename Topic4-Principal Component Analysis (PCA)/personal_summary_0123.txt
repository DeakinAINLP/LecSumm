 The topics that were covered during topic 3 are unsupervised machine learning, examples of different distance metrics, Kmeans clustering, Kmeans++ clustering, other clustering algorithms including  DBSCAN. Then, hierarchical clustering, Kmeans clustering using Python, performance of Kmeans clustering evaluation topics were covered.  I referred to the unit site contents for learning the topics that were covered in topic 3 along with the external video links and articles provided.  The learning journey started with the basics of unsupervised machine learning where the two aspects of it, namely clustering and dimensionality reduction were learnt. Then, I acquired knowledge about measuring distances between different data points, distance metrics, types of distance measurements along with examples (Euclidean distance, Cosine distance, Mahalanobis distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, Jaccard distance). I gained an idea on what Clustering and its applications , clustering algorithms overview. Then, I gathered knowledge about how Kmeans algorithm work, evaluation of clustering both external and internal assessment. Then, learnt about Rand index which is a measure of the similarity between two data clusters, Purity which is a way of quality measurement in clustering methods, Mutual information, Silhouette Coefficient. Later, I learnt the limitations of Kmeans, Clustering with Kmeans++ algorithm. Then, I acquired knowledge on other clustering algorithms like Hierarchical clustering(Agglomerative(bottom-up) & Divisive clustering(top-down)), DBSCAN(density based), Shape-based clustering. Finally,  implementation of kmeans clustering, evaluating performance of kmeans clustering and DBSCAN & hierarchical clustering using python was learnt.
