Main learning points:  K-means clustering is susceptible to noise, cannot find clusters of arbitrary shapes and requires k to be supplied beforehand.    The elbow method can find the optimal k in k-means. However, it does not always give a  clear answer.    K-medians is less affected by noise, but still cannot identify noisy points.  DBSCAN: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise    Count the number points 'close' to a given point, for all points.  o  A point is 'close' if within a radius of the given point (neighbourhood) o  The radius is a user-defined parameter    Define a core point.  o  A point is considered a core point if it has at least a minimum number of 'close'  points.  o  This minimum is a user-defined parameter. o  All points are now classified as 'core' or 'non-core'   Randomly pick a core point. This is where the first cluster starts  o  Core points that are close to this starting point are added to the first cluster o  Core points that are close to this cluster join it. Core points that are close to the  growing cluster will continue to join it.  o  As the cluster grows, there will be no more core point left to extend the cluster o  Add all non-core points that are close to the cluster's border points. Do not extend off  non-core points.  o  The first cluster is now complete    Pick another random core point to repeat the process. When all core points are assigned to  a cluster the process is finished    Any remaining non-core points, which are not assigned to any cluster, are called outliers   Clusters are formed sequentially. Therefore, a point's cluster assignment could be  dependent on order.  Cluster evaluation:    External assessment (comparison against ground truth or ‘gold standard)’:  o  Rand Index o  Purity o  Mutual Information    Internal assessment:  Silhouette coefficient (internal)    Ranges from -1 (poor clustering) to 1 (both clusters are far away), coefficient of 0 means  clustering is indifferent.    Consists of:  o  cohesion or a(i) (measures a given point’s distance to other points within same  cluster)  o  separation or b(i) (measures given point’s distance with points in other clusters)  1.  Calculate the average distance of a given point to all other points of the same cluster. This  is a(i)  2.  Calculate the average distance of a given point to all other points of the closest  neighbouring cluster. This is b(i)  3.  The Silhouette value of this given point is:  𝑎(𝑖) − 𝑏(𝑖) 𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑜𝑓 {𝑎(𝑖), 𝑏(𝑖)}
