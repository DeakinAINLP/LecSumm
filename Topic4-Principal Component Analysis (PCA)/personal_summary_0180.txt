1)    Refer to python code 2)  As per the plot on distortion score using Elbow for Kmeans clustering, elbow is found at 6.  Optimum no of cluster on the dataset are 6.  3)       AS per below purity score of 0.573 when 6 cluster are selected and KMeans clustering is performed. Accuracy, macro average and weighted average of precision, recall, f1-score are obtained as below.  4)     When repeat clustering using KMeans is done, following performance is obtained.  increased purity score of 0.569 is achieved compared to Kmeans done earlier with less repetition. Similarly, precision, recall, fi-score have increased. This could because more        clustering is performed allowing data to fall under a much closer centroid/cluster.  5)  Optimum min_sample is assumed to be anything greater than the dimensions of the dataset. To Obtain optimum eps value distances between nearest neighbours are calculated and the part where the graph is the most curved is selected to be the  optimum eps value and it identified to happen at eps= 22    The Purity score obtained is similar to the KMeans when repeated clustering was done 50 times as below. Accuracy and average values of precision, recall and f1-scare was improved compared to that of the KMeans clustering done initially.
