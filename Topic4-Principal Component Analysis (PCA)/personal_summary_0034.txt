The key points covered in topic three are:  1.  Distance measures used in machine learning: distances are fundamental to ML as they allow measurement of how different or similar two samples are.  Additionally, for regression problems, the error between expected value and predicted value is also a distance.  Distance measures include Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, Jaccard, etc.  2.  Unsupervised learning via clustering: Concepts of KMeans, kMeans++, DBScan, and  Hierarchical clustering and how to evaluate the models.  3.  Python libraries to perform kMeans, DBScan and Agglomerative clustering and to determine  optimal number of clusters.
