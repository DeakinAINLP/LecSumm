The main points that have been covered this topic were a lot of in-depth informa(cid:415)on about clustering and background knowledge needed to u(cid:415)lise the algorithms eﬀec(cid:415)vely. There was a lot of informa(cid:415)on about KMeans, KMeans++, how they worked, how to use them, and some limita(cid:415)ons. The topic also covered informa(cid:415)on regarding the distance metrics that are actually used in these clustering algorithms, such as Euclidean distance which is the most commonly used one for example in KMeans. There was also learning about addi(cid:415)onal clustering methods, which were mainly aimed for postgraduate students, such as informa(cid:415)on about DBSCAN, which was also assessed. This topic also covered the various assessment methods which are used to judge and measure the performance of these clustering algorithms, and these are in 2 categories, external and internal measurements / assessment. I have read a lot of code libraries, as it was hard to understand how to u(cid:415)lise a lot of these algorithms, so I have read libraries for KMeans, silhoue(cid:425)e visualizer, Kmean visualizer, silhoue(cid:425)e score, DBSCAN, just to name a few. I have gained a lot of knowledge through this content and the assessment about clustering algorithms and how to u(cid:415)lise them, and also the aﬀect that parameters can have, such as in DBSCAN, where parameters heavily inﬂuence the results that are achieved.
