In topic 3 we expanded on the implementation of distance and clustering with data and machine learning. These segments included:  -  Measuring distance and similarity between different data points and using distance metrics and  learning about the different types of distance measurements, such as:  Euclidean distance.  o o  Cosine Distance o  Cityblock/Manhattan Distance o  Minkowski Distance o Jaccard Distance -  How KMeans works with a set of data. -  Clustering, its applications with data and different algorithms of clustering - -  The evaluation of clustering, which included the methods of internal and external assessment. The limitations of KMeans clustering, such as its inability to find clusters of arbitrary shapes and it cannot detect ‘noisy’ data. The difference between Kmeans and Kmeans++, and how to utilize Kmeans++ within Machine Learning  -  -  Other clustering algorithms, such as: -  Hierarchial Clustering -  DBSCAN (Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise) -  Shape-based clustering  My Reading list
