In  this  topic  mainly  cover  clustering  concept  which  involves  grouping  similar  data  points together based on the features. There are several algorithms used for clustering including K- means, hierarchical clustering, and etc. In the lesson, also talk about the distance metrics, which are used to quantify the similarity between data points. a) Euclidean distance – Measure the straight line distance between two points in Euclidean space.  b) Manhattan distance – L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute difference between their coordinates.  c) Cosine distance – Dealing text or other high dimensional data. Measure the cosine of the angle between two vectors.  e) Jaccard distance- Categorical data, measures the similarity between two sets f) Minkowski distance – Distance metric that includes both Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance g) Chebyshev distance – Measure the distance between two points in a space with uniform grid-like topology.
