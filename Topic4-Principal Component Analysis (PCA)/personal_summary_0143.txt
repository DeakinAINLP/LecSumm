 The main points covered in this topic are all about distance metrics, types of distance measurements, clustering and its applications, clustering algorithms, how kmeans works, evaluation of clustering, limitation of kmeans, clustering with kmeans++, other clustering algorithms. Then we started to learn kmeans clustering, evaluation performance of kmeans clustering, DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering using python.
