In topic 3, we study about the various clustering methods and its application using python which we can use to create unsupervised models, reduce dimensionality of the data and how to visualize high dimensional data.  Clustering algorithms are unsupervised machine learning techniques that group similar data points together based on their patterns or similarities. They have wide-ranging applications in exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, image and document analysis, and more.  Clustering helps in understanding data structure, identifying hidden patterns, and organizing large datasets without the need for labeled training data. It enables us to gain insights, make informed decisions, and extract meaningful information from complex datasets.  K-means is a popular clustering algorithm that aims to partition data points into K distinct clusters. It operates by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest centroid and recalculating the centroids based on the new assignments. This process continues until convergence, where the centroids no longer change significantly  DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups data points based on their density and proximity.DBSCAN does not require the number of clusters to be predefined and is effective in handling datasets with varying density  Hierarchical clustering is a clustering algorithm that builds a tree-like structure of clusters by merging or dividing them based on similarity. It does not require the number of clusters to be specified and provides a hierarchical representation of the data. It is used to explore relationships and uncover nested structures in datasets.
