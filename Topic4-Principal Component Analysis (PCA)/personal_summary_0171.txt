Topic 3 was about Distance metrics. The algorithms used in machine learning frequently use distance measurements. Distance measurements are functions that specify the separation between any two instances of data.  We got to know more about the different distance metrics we later studied about the clustering and its application and also about the clustering algorithm. The process of clustering clusters data points. It organises unclassified material with unknown goals using features that are similar to and different from one other. Because it can handle enormous volumes of uncategorized data, it is very beneficial in unsupervised learning. But, because it forms groups, it is also helpful in supervised learning.  We got to know how the Kmean algorithm works . Then we got to know more about evaluating the cluster and also about the limitations about the kmean algorithm .  We read about the clustering with Kmean++ algorithm and the other different clustering such as Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN (density based) and Shape-based  Clustering. We applied these with python for the better understanding
