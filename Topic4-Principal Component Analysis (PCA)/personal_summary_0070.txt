  Distance Metrics: measuring similarity or distances between different data  points is fundamental to machine learning algorithms(unsupervised learning  problems, supervised learning methods)   Distance Measurement Types: City block/Manhattan distance, Euclidean  Distance, Chebyshev Distance, Minkowski Distance, Cosine Distance,  Mahalanobis Distance, Jaccard Distance   Clustering Goals: minimize intra-distance, maximize inter-distance   Kmeans: search for the best centroids by alternating between two methods:  assign data points to clusters based on the current defined centroids, choose  centroids based on the current assignment of data points to clusters   Evaluation of Clustering: Rand Index, Purity, Mutual Information, Silhouette  Coefficient   Limitation of Kmeans: random initialization, supply the number of clusters  beforehand, cannot find clusters of arbitrary shapes, cannot detect noisy data
