Measuring distances Definition and Properties Different types of distance measurements are explained: 1.  Euclidean distance: It is the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space, computed using the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding features. 2.  Cosine distance: It measures the cosine of the angle between two feature vectors, indicating their similarity. 3.  Mahalanobis distance: It measures the distance between two points in multivariate space, taking into account the covariance matrix of the data. 4.  Cityblock/Manhattan distance: It calculates the sum of absolute differences between corresponding features of two vectors. 5.  Minkowski distance: It defines a distance between two points in a vector space,generalizing both Euclidean and Manhattan distances. 6.  Jaccard distance: It measures the diversity between two sets using binary vectors, indicating the presence or absence of features. Clustering and its applications Clustering algorithms are described as tools used in unsupervised learning to handle large amounts of unclassified data. However, they can also be useful in supervised learning. The goals of clustering algorithms are identified as grouping unlabelled data objects with similar properties, discovering interesting clusters in the data, and finding a valid or useful organization of the data. To achieve these goals, these steps are taken: defining a distance metric between objects, defining an objective function that guides the clustering process, and devising an algorithm to optimize the objective function. How Kmeans Works In K-means, 'k' represents the centre points of clusters. The algorithm starts with these centroids and then measures each data point to find its closest centroid. The algorithm stores k centroids to define the clusters. A data point is assigned to a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster's centroid than to any other centroid. The algorithm iteratively alternates between two steps: assigning data points to clusters based on the current centroids and choosing centroids based on the current assignment of data points to clusters. Steps 1 and 2 are repeated until a useful grouping of data points is achieved. The K-means algorithm was independently discovered in the 1960s and 1970s and remains the preferred choice for analysis tasks due to its reasonably accurate performance. Evaluation of clustering The main categories of evaluation methods mentioned are external assessment and internal assessment. External assessment involves comparing the clustering performance to a known clustering or ground truth. The Rand Index is introduced as a measure of similarity between two data clusters. It compares the assignments of data instances to different clusters suggested by a clustering algorithm to the ground truth cluster assignments. The Rand Index calculates the similarity, ignoring permutations, by considering the number of pairs of data instances in the same cluster or different clusters. Internal assessment aims to determine if clustering follows certain intrinsic assumptions. Examples of internal evaluation methods mentioned are the Silhouette coefficient, Dunn index, and mutual information. The Silhouette coefficient measures the similarity of an object to its own cluster compared to other clusters. It calculates the average distance between instances of the same cluster and the average distance between instances of different clusters. A high Silhouette coefficient indicates a well-matched object to its own cluster. Purity is another evaluation method discussed, which measures the quality of clustering in terms of class labels. Each cluster is assigned to the class label with the majority within the cluster, and the accuracy of the assignment is measured by counting the number of correctly assigned instances divided by the total number of instances. However, purity has a disadvantage in cases where each point forms its own cluster, resulting in high purity but lacking meaningful clustering. Limitations of Kmeans The key limitations highlighted are as follows: 1.  Random Initialization: K-means clustering can produce different clusters each time due to random initialization. To mitigate this, the K-means++ initialization algorithm is suggested as a better alternative. 2.  Predefined Number of Clusters: K-means requires the number of clusters to be specified in advance. The Elbow Method is introduced as a solution to determine the appropriate number of clusters. It involves running K-means with different values of k and calculating the sum of squared errors (SSE) for each value. The "elbow" point in the SSE plot indicates the optimal number of clusters. 3.  Limitation in Cluster Shapes: K-means is not capable of identifying clusters with arbitrary shapes. It assumes that clusters are convex and isotropic. For datasets with complex cluster shapes, alternative clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Models can be more suitable. Inability to Detect Noisy Data: K-means cannot effectively identify and handle noisy data points that should be excluded from cluster analysis. The K-median method is mentioned as less affected by noise, but it also lacks explicit noise detection capabilities. Kmeans with Kmeans++ Kmeans++ steps: 1.  Choose one centroid randomly from the dataset. 2.  Calculate the shortest distance (denoted as) from each data point to the closest centroid that has been selected so far. 3.  Select the next centroid from the dataset with a probability proportional to. This ensures that data points farther from existing centroids are more likely to be chosen as new centroids. 4.  Repeat step 2 and 3 until the desired number of centroids has been initialized. The Kmeans++ algorithm improves upon the random initialization used by K-means by carefully selecting initial centroids based on their distances from existing centroids. This approach helps in achieving better clustering results.
