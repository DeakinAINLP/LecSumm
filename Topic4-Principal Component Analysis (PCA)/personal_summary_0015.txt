Topic three has explored unsupervised machine learning, focusing largely on Kmeans clustering. We initially covered various methods of measuring distances and utilised this knowledge to explore clustering and its applications. After this we focused on Kmeans clustering, how to evaluate it and its limitations. The final portion of the topic was based around the Python application of Kmeans and a couple of the evaluation methods.
