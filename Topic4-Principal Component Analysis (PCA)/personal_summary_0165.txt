This topic, we covered the topic of clustering in machine learning. We learned about  different clustering algorithms such as K-Means and DBSCAN, and how to evaluate their performance using metrics like silhouette score, adjusted Rand index, homogeneity score, completeness score, and V-measure score. We also learned about techniques for selecting the optimal number of clusters and hyperparameters for clustering algorithms.
