 This topic was a deep dive into clustering, which can be either an unsupervised or supervised machine learning task. The following points were covered:  Applications of clustering  Clustering is used to find underlying patterns in data. This can be useful for many applications, such as segmenting customer data, building recommendation systems, detecting anomalies, etc.  Distance Metrics  Different ways to calculate distance between data points and clusters in  order to form the clusters and also to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Distance measures include: Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Jaccard distance, etc.  KMeans clustering  How the KMeans algorithm works Ways to initialize clusters and impact on results How to evaluate the algorithm, both for labelled and unlabelled data Silhouette score and elbow method to determine optimal number of  clusters Other clustering methods Hierarchical  Agglomerative – ‘bottom-up’ Divisive = ‘top-down’  Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) Shape-Based Clustering  How to perform clustering in python Scikit learn library Different clustering algorithms and their libraries Metrics Function to calculate purity – contingency matrix Classification report
