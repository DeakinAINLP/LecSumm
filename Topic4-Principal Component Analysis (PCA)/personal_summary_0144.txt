This topic starts with the introduction of the next topicâ€™s plans regarding learning, In the next two topics, we will explore more about unsupervised machine learning, covering clustering and dimensionality reduction. The course aims to provide the theoretical understanding and practical applications of these techniques using Python packages, including creating unsupervised models, reducing dimensionality, and visualizing high- dimensional data. The learning goals include using clustering for revealing patterns from unlabelled data, learning techniques to reduce dimensionality, and applying suitable clustering/dimensionality reduction techniques to perform unsupervised learning of data in a real-world scenario. After that, Then we start are learning of this topic from a learning the importance of distance metrics in machine learning algorithms and their use in measuring the similarity or distance between different data points. we learn about the three properties of distance metrics and understand the examples of their applications in various machine learning algorithms such as clustering, K-Nearest-Neighbor, support vector machines, data visualization, information retrieval, and ranking. we also presented different types of distance measurements such as Euclidean distance, cosine distance, Mahalanobis distance, city block/Manhattan distance, Makowski distance, and Jaccard distance, and their calculations with examples. The next topic we got familiar with was clustering, We came to know about the concept of clustering in machine learning and how it can be used to group unclassified data points based on their similarity and differences. we come to know why clustering is useful. Clustering is particularly useful in unsupervised learning as it can handle vast amounts of uncategorized data, but can also be useful in supervised learning. The article outlines the two algorithmic goals of clustering algorithms, which are to minimize intra-distance and maximize inter-distance. The author also provides a generic set-up for clustering methods that involves defining a distance metric between objects, defining an objective function, and devising an algorithm to optimize the objective function. Then we get introduced to the K-means clustering algorithm, which is a popular and efficient unsupervised learning algorithm used for grouping data points into clusters we also learn about how the algorithm uses centroids and measures the distance between data points and the centroids to form clusters. Additionally, we also learn about the two methods that K- means uses to search for the best centroids and the repeated process until a useful grouping of data points is achieved. Then we learn about the evaluation methods for clustering algorithms and the use of the purity metric as a way of measuring the quality of clustering, where the algorithm tries to group data points together based on the majority of the class labels assigned to each point we also learn about the Rand index, mutual information, silhouette coefficient, and The importance of evaluating clustering results to ensure their usefulness in real-world applications. The Rand index measures the similarity between two data clusters, while mutual information and silhouette coefficient evaluate the similarity between clustering assignments.  After it, we learn about the limitations of k-means, including the need for pre-specifying the number of clusters, random initialization, and difficulty in identifying noisy data points. We also get introduced to the Elbow Method as a solution to determine the appropriate number of clusters. The method involves running the K-means algorithm for different values and   computing the sum of squared errors (SSE) to determine the elbow point, which represents the optimal number of clusters. We can't forget the importance of the Kmeans++ algorithm that we learned this topic, which is used for selecting initial centroid values for the Kmeans clustering algorithm. Kmeans++ starts by randomly choosing one centroid from the dataset, then chooses subsequent centroids based on the distance to previously chosen centroids. The best thing about this algorithm is that The algorithm has a theoretical guarantee of convergence to the best solution, unlike Kmeans with random initialization. As we got familiar with kmeans and its application, and limitations I also came to know about other clustering methods. In Flat Clustering, there are Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and Shape- based clustering. Hierarchical clustering algorithms find clusters in a predetermined order and have two types: bottom-up (agglomerative) and top-down (divisive). DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm that clusters certain items based on a given data point, using a user- defined minimum number of data points and distance. Shape-based clustering algorithms like VAT and iVAT help in exploratory data analysis by emphasizing the dissimilarities between data points to reveal underlying clustering structures. Additionally, I learned about, how to implement KMeans clustering in Python using the Scikit learn package. It includes loading CSV files for clustering, merging data frames, defining the number of clusters using the elbow method, and visualizing the results using the yellowbrick library. KMeans is a method for finding clusters and cluster centers in unlabelled data by grouping together data points with similar distances within a cluster. If I talk about the elbow method then, The elbow method helps to determine the optimal number of clusters by comparing the distortion metric for different values of k. We learn about how to use Python for KMeans clustering to group unlabelled data points into clusters. how to load and prepare the data for clustering, as well as how to use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. Then we also learn about training and testing the KMeans model with the data and evaluating its performance using different metrics such as purity, mutual information, silhouette coefficient, f1, recall, accuracy, and precision. Moreover, we use two clustering techniques: DBSCAN and Hierarchical clustering. DBSCAN is a density-based spatial clustering algorithm that finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them. Hierarchical clustering is a bottom-up approach that groups similar data points into clusters based on the distance between them. Both techniques use the purity score as a performance metric.  In conclusion, this topic we learned a lot regarding clustering, about multiple algorithms which we use for clustering like kmean, flat clustering, hierarchical clustering, etc. The practical implementation of clustering algorithms using Python was also covered. In the upcoming topic, the focus will be on dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and SVD. Additionally, I have completed the third-topic quiz and attached my results with the pdf.
