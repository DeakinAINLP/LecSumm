The most related examples in machine learning are:  ▪  clustering algorithms (we looked at examples of clustering last topic) ▪  K-Nearest-Neighbor ▪  Support Vector Machines (SVM) ▪  data visualization ▪ ▪  information retrieval ranking  The process of MClustering groups data points. It employs traits (or dimensions) that are similar and different from one other to form groups in unclassified material with unknown objectives. In this algorithm, k represents the centre points of clusters. You start off with these centroids and then measure teach data point to find its closest centroid.
