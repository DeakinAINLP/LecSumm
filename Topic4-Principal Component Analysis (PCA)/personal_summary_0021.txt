The third topic introduces an aspect of unsupervised machine learning - clustering. A wide variety of concepts related to clustering was discussed. Some of the notable points that were explored during the third topic are:  Distance metrics Clustering Algorithms distance, Cosine distance, Minkowski distance and so on : We looked at different distance metrics such as Euclidean : Clustering algorithms group data points based on similarities and differences in their features, without known targets. The goals are to group similar data points, find unexpected clusters, and organize data. To achieve this, objective functions are defined to minimize intra- distance and maximize inter-distance. The process involves defining a K-Means Algorithm:  distance metric, objective function, and algorithm to optimize it. The most popular clustering algorithm in machine learning is called K-means. It is simple and fast. The K-Means algorithm attempts to classify objects into a pre-determined number of clusters by finding optimal central points(called centroids) for each cluster. Each object Silhouette Coefficient is classified with respect to the cluster represented by the closest centroid.If the ground truth labels are not known, evaluation must be performed using the model itself. The Silhouette Coefficient is an example of such an evaluation, where a higher Silhouette Coefficient score relates to a model with better defined clusters.
