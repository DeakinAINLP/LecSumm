Topic 3 Key Learning Points Distances metrics: similarity of distances is used in Mutiple machine learning methods such as the followings:    K-Nearest-Neighbor   Support Vector Machines (SVM)   data visualization    information retrieval ranking  Euclidean distance  Euclidean distance is the ordinary straight-line between two points in Euclidean space. For any two data instances, represented by d-dimensional feature vectors xi,xj their Euclidean distance is computed as:  We use this distance when we have numeric values and we want to measure absolute distances  Cosine distance  Is used as a method of distances, when the magnitude of the vectors doesn't matter (we are seeking the angle between the two vectors)  Mahalanobis distance  This distance is used when we have continues numerical variables and we want absolute distances, but we want to remove redundancies.  Cityblock/Manhattan distance  Minkowski distance  Is generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distances but define based on norm p       Jaccard distance  Finds similarities between sets  Kmean  Is an algorithm used to cluster data points within a dataset, below is notation of KMean optimization function:  How it works:  Evaluation of Clustering    Homogeneity (Purity): each cluster is assigned to a class that has the majority   Rand Index: The Rand index is a measure of the similarity between two data clusters. We have the assignments of data instances to different clusters suggested by a clustering algorithm (we know the ground truth)    Mutual Information: it measures the agreement between two clustering assignments such as C  and Câ€², so the aim is almost same as the Rand Inde    Silhouette Coefficient: The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion/similarity) compared to other clusters (separation/difference). This method has the advantage that it does not require the ground truth cluster assignments  Other clustering algorithms:    Kmeans (as we know)   Hierarchical clustering   DBSCAN (density based)   Shape-based  Clustering
