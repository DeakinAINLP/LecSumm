Distance Measures Satisfy the following three properties: 1. For any instance xi, distance with itself is zero. That is, d(xi,xi) = 0 2. For any instance pairs xi and xj, the distance is non-negative and symmetric. That is, d(xi, xj) >= 0 and d(xi,xj) = d(xj,xi) 3. Distance measure follows triangular inequality. That is, d(xi,xk) <= d(xi,xj) + d(xj,xk)  Euclidian Distance Is appropriate when we have continuous numerical variables, and we want to reflect absolute distances.  Cosine Distance Cosine distance is used as a metric for measuring distances when the magnitude of the variables does not matter. i.e., the angle between two vectors.  Manalanobis Distance Is appropriate when we have continuous numerical variables, and we want to reflect absolute distances, but we want to remove redundancies. i.e., remove the effect of repeated variables.  Cityblock/Manhattan Distance Yields similar results to Euclidean Distance, however the effect of a large difference in a single dimension is dampened since the distances are not squared.  Minkowski Distance Is a generalisation of Euclidian Distance and Cityblock Distance defined for any p-norm.  Jaccard Distance Is used to measure the diversity of any two sets.
