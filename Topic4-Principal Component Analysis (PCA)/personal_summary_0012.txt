This topic began to introduce how to begin the process of unsupervised machine learning and focused on clustering. Clustering is a way to find commonality in data sets and is like picking out data points by because they seem similar to each other and assigning all of those to a labelled cluster. This can be useful to make inferences about particular groups and make it easier to predict outcomes or gain insights from those groups as they are likely strongly related. It can be difficult and timely to establish clusters but we learned that the KMeans approach is a good way to determine centroids of a cluster for grouping data points that are closely related together. However choosing the number of clusters to divide up a data set can make a big difference in the accuracy of the results. This can be done with external assessments, such as ground truth where there are external results that are known to be accurate that can be compared against. Internal assessments such as purity, rand index and silhouette can be utilised to evaluate the results. The pass activity mainly focused on evaluating clusters utilising a silhouette coefficient. It was an interesting exercise to further expand upon the previous topics and become more familiar with Python, numpy, pandas and scikit-learn. I have to admit that machine learning and the processes are not something that I find very intuitive to learn and the gradual increase in complexity and requirements of the tasks are great and itâ€™s has been good to learn new concepts with a focus on one or two aspects such as  KMeans within scikit-learn .
