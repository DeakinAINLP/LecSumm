During topic three, various important topics related to unsupervised learning were covered.  These  included  fundamental  concepts  such  as  Euclidean  distance,  Cosine distance, and Manhattan distance. The lecture explored the clustering technique and its  application,  providing  in-depth  information  about  Kmeans,  the  most  used clustering algorithm in machine learning. Additionally, the lecture covered evaluating clustering,  the  limitations  of  Kmeans,  and  clustering  with  Kmeans++.  Other  topics included  different  clustering  algorithms,  such  as  hierarchical,  DBSCAN,  and  Shape- based  clustering.  The  topicly  material  also  provided  practical  implementation  of Kmeans, which was useful in completing the topicly workshop.
