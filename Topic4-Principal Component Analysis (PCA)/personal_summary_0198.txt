Clustering  Module Learning Objectives –  I certify that I have successfully achieved the below mentioned learning goals.  1.  Use clustering for revealing patterns from unlabeled data. 2.  Learn techniques to reduce dimensionality. 3.  Apply  suitable  clustering  /  dimensionality  reduction  techniques  to  performed  unsupervised learning of data in a real-world scenario.  Summary and reflection –  The  pages  below  contain  the  handwritten  summary  referring  to  the  given  learning resources. It includes all the important points of the topic 3 module.  In  this  topic  we  mainly  focused  on  data  clustering  and  related  algorithms.  First,  we  learnt how  to  measure  distance  and  different  examples  of  different  distance  metrics.  Then  we learnt  what  exactly  is  clustering,  how  important  it  is  and  its  applications.  Then  we  were introduced  to  a  very  important  topic,  Kmeans  and  how  it  works.  Then  we  learnt  how  to properly evaluate clustering. As in the previous chapter we were introduced to Kmeans, in this part we were also introduced to limitations of Kmeans. Then we did data clustering with Kmeans using python. We were briefly introduced to other different algorithms of clustering.  In some previous units I completed, I learnt the basics of data clustering, especially in data science concepts unit. But in machine learning I had the opportunity to dive deep into this area and use the algorithms together with Kmeans to process and achieve specific outcomes in different data related real-life scenarios which needs data clustering done properly. And the  practical  part  done  with  python  was  a  little  bit  confusing  at  first  but  was  able  to understand all the necessary commands and ways of implementations by referring to both given resources and online resources.
