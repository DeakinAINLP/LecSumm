 The Main points that I’ve covered in the second topic are as follows:  ➢  I have understood the concept Unsupervised Machine learning models. ➢  I got to know about the different evaluation metrics used for the unsupervised machine  learning and their uses with respect to data.  ➢  I have completed the task of this topic in which I have used Kmeans clustering and DBSCAN  Algorithms  ➢  I got familiar with Clustering and Dimensionality reduction in this topic.  My Learning summary Based on 3rd Topics Lecture was about the analysing the data without knowing the actual output for which we say unsupervised machine learning. And for this kind of data we use clustering techniques to get the best outcome from the dataset. I have applied different evaluation techniques such as Silhoutte co-efficient to find the optimum values and number of clusters and other metrics such as rand index, Homogeneity, completeness score and V-measure scores for the determination of the best score while comparing it with other algorithms.  Knowledge gained with Lecture slides.  In the Overall topic 2 I have gained the Knowledge of how to deal with the unstructured data and implement unsupervised machine learning algorithms. I got very familiar with DBSCAN (Density- Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and KMeans Clustering algorithms as I have implemented these models in this task 3.1.  By understanding the limitations of KMeans algorithm I have understood that it cannot find clusters of arbitrary shapes and KMeans cannot detect the noisy data points. The KMeans++ algorithm also very interesting as I noticed that the more it gets iterated the best solution we get.  Hence the Topic two was very useful and interesting by understanding the concept of Clustering Techniques.  I have Attempted the Topic 3 Quiz and the result is displayed below:
