This topic's main content is the calculation and code of machine learning. This topic's main content is measuring the distance between points, clustering and how to use  multiple clustering in python.  Measure the distance between points.  Euclidean  distance,  Cosine  distance,  Mahalanobis  distance,  Cityblock/Manhattan  distance,  Minkowski distance, Jaccard distance  clustering  Contains Kmeans and Kmeans++, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN (density based)  Shape-based Clustering. Clustering evaluation Rand Index, Purity, Mutual Information, Silhouette Coefficient.  Use multiple clustering in python.  It  involves  DBSCAN,  Hierarchical  clustering,  Kmean  and  Kmean++.  The  performance  indicator: Purity. The elbow method finds the K value. The tables are merged.
