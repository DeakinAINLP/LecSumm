 This topic talks about some main points surrounding unsupervised machine learning. To begin with, distance measurements specify different methods of calculating distances in a vector space. It is then used to do clustering. There are several clustering algorithms but this topic mainly talks about how Kmeans works. I watched some videos online to learn the internal mechanisms of the Kmeans algorithm. After learning that, I got the idea of the pros and cons of it. Meanwhile, The evaluation of the clustering model is elaborated, in which the Silhouette Coefficient is frequently used later due to its characteristics. Kmeans++ is the refined version of Kmeans while other clustering algorithms can substitute for Kmeans in some areas where Kmeans has some drawbacks. Finally, it demonstrates how to use Python to apply Kmeans to specific data as well as how to assess performance.  During this learning, I learned some concepts mainly via Wikipedia, where there are a lot of detailed explanations. DBSCAN is impressive since the method of clustering is very different from K-means.
