 Topic -3 gave a details overview clustering and its types. Some of the important points are listed  below:  1.  Measuring distance [1]: Distance metrics, also known as distance measures, are functions  used to quantify the similarity or dissimilarity between two data points in a dataset. They  play  a  crucial  role  in  many  machine  learning  algorithms,  including  clustering,  classification, and regression.  2.  Different metrics can be used depending on the nature of the data. Distance metrics are  widely  used  in  clustering  algorithms,  K-Nearest-Neighbor,  SVM,  data  visualization,  information retrieval, and ranking [2].  3.  Distance measures should satisfy three properties: distance with itself is zero, distance is  non-negative  and  symmetric  between  two  instances,  and  distance  measure  follows  triangular inequality. These properties collectively define a distance metric [1].  4.  Distance  metrics  can  be  based  on  various  mathematical  concepts,  such  as  Euclidean  distance, Manhattan distance, cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and others.  5.  Clustering  is  widely  used  in  unsupervised  learning  but  can  also  be  used  in  supervised  learning. The goal of clustering algorithms is to group data objects with similar properties  together and find interesting and useful organizations of the data. Clustering algorithms  achieve  these  goals  by  minimizing  intra-distance  (distance  between  points  in  the  same  cluster)  and maximizing inter-distance (distance  between points from  different  clusters)  [3].    6.  K-means clustering algorithm [3] works by defining k centroids that represent the center  points of clusters, and then measuring each data point to find its closest centroid. K-means  stores the centroids for defining clusters, and a data point is considered to be in a particular  cluster  if  it  is  closer  to  that  clusterâ€™s  centroid  than  any  other  centroid.  The  algorithm  searches for the best centroids by alternating between two methods: assigning data points  to  clusters  based  on  the  current  defined  centroids  and  choosing  centroids  based  on  the  current  assignment  of  data  points  to  clusters.  This  process  is  repeated  until  a  useful  grouping of data points is achieved.  7.  Evaluation  parameters  of  clustering  are:  purity,  Rand  Index,  Mutual  Information,  Silhouette Coefficient [4].  8.  Some limitations of K-means clustering algorithm are:  a.  It requires prior knowledge of the number of clusters.  b.  It is sensitive to initial conditions.  c.  It may converge to a local minimum.  d.  It does not work well with non-linear data.  e.  It is affected by outliers.  9.  K-means++ is an extension of the K-means clustering algorithm that aims to select initial  centroids that are more spread out and representative of the data [5].  10. In K-means++, the first centroid is selected uniformly at random from the data points. For  each  subsequent  centroid,  the  distance  of  each  data  point  from  its  nearest  centroid  is  calculated,  and  the  next  centroid  is  chosen  from  the  data  points  with  probability  proportional to the squared distance. This process continues until K centroids have been  chosen.  11. Hierarchical clustering is a method that seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters, also known  as a dendrogram, by recursively dividing a dataset into smaller clusters. It can be divided  into  two  main  types:  agglomerative  hierarchical  clustering,  which  starts  with  each  data  point as a separate cluster and then merges them, and divisive hierarchical clustering, which  starts with all the data points in one cluster and then splits them [6].  12. DBSCAN, on the other hand, is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together  points that are closely packed together and separated from areas with low density. It works  by identifying core points, which are points that have a sufficient number of other points  in  their neighborhood, and expanding  clusters  around them. DBSCAN does  not  require  specifying the number of clusters in advance, and it is particularly useful for datasets with  complex structures or noise [6] .
