# LecSumm

This repository contains a dataset for the paper [Can Language Models Capture Human Writing Preferences for Domain-Specific Text Summarization?](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.315.pdf), which has been accepted by Findings of ACL 2025.

# Dataset

The dataset covers ten topic areas related to machine learning. Each topic folder includes:

- An original lecture note (`input.txt`), which serves as the source document for summarization;
- 200 personalized summaries (`personal_summary_0001.txt` to `personal_summary_0200.txt`), reflecting different annotatorsâ€™ understanding and summarization styles of the same content.
