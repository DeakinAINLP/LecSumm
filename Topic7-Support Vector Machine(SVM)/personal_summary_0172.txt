Topic 6 Learning Summary Report  Name: Viola Birech  Assignment: Task 6.1P  Institution: Deakin University  Date: 02/05/2023  1         Summary Report  Topic 6 Learning Summary  In topic 6 of our machine learning class, we covered a range of topics related to linear  regression model. It is a type of machine learning that attempts to model the relationship between two  variables: x the feature vector and y the output. Its linear relationship is measured through covariance  that is calculated by the formula; Σ E ((X – μ) E (Y – ν)) / n – 1.  We also explored the Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct  when the output values of the feature vectors are binary. Principal component analysis (PCA),  correlation-based feature selection, and recursive feature elimination are typical feature selection  methods. The specific challenge at hand and the features in the dataset determine the feature selection  method to use. To find the most significant features in a dataset, linear regression can be used as a  feature selection strategy. The basic idea behind using linear regression for feature selection is to  evaluate the strength of the relationship between each feature and the target variable. The features  with the highest absolute coefficient values can be found using linear regression.  Reflection  During topic 6 of my machine learning class, I studied various topics related to clustering. I  learned about how the default, after you have defined the data sources for a mining structure, the Data  Mining Wizard will divide the data into two sets: one with 70 percent of the source data, for training  the model, and one with 30 percent of the source data, for testing the model. This default was chosen  because a 70-30 ratio is often used in data mining, but with SQL Server Analysis Services you can  change this ratio to suit your requirements.  Overall, I found the topic 6 topics very informative and relevant to the field of machine  learning. I look forward to applying these techniques in practical projects and experiments.  Summary of Reading List  The sixth section of the machine learning course incorporated a range of resources for  utilization which were all like the previous topics’ resources. I found these resources very helpful to  my understanding of the content studied. These readings consist of textbooks such as, Hands-On  Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow and Python Machine Learning  2   Other additional resources are the various code libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and  scikit-learn which can be heavily utilized to learn and practicalize the lessons learnt. Research papers  and articles from journals are also crucial resources to enhance investigation on current research areas  in the field of machine learning. Online platforms like Kaggle and Data Camp are also critical in  utilization as supplementary materials for practice exercises and tutorials.  Quiz Score  3
