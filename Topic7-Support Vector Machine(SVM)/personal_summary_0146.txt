The main points covered in this topic are all about example of linear regression, linear regression formulation, linear classification, generalisation and complexity, logistic regression formulation, training a logistic regression model, logistic regression example, model complexity, regularised linear models, linear regression for feature selection. Then we started to implement regularised linear regression in python and logistic regression in python.
