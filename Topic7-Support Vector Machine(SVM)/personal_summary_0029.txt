Linear  regression  is  a  supervised  machine  learning  algorithm  used  to  predict  continuous numerical  values.  The  algorithm  assumes  a  linear  relationship  between  input  variables  and output  variables.  It  aims  to  find  the  best-fit  line  that  minimizes  the  difference  between  the predicted values and the actual values.  Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict binary outcomes. It models the probability of an outcome as a function of input variables and tries to find the best coefficients that maximize the likelihood of observed outcomes. The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function, maps the output of the linear equation to a probability between 0 and  1.  Logistic  regression  is  useful  in  applications  such  as  fraud  detection  and  disease diagnosis.  Model complexity refers to the level of flexibility or complexity in a machine learning model. A model that is too simple may not capture the underlying patterns in the data, while a model that is too complex may capture the noise in the data instead of the underlying patterns. The goal is to find the optimal model complexity that balances bias and variance. Bias refers to the error  introduced  by  approximating  a  real-life  problem  with  a  simplified  model.  High-bias models are less complex and have a higher error on the training set. Variance refers to the error introduced  by  modelling  random  noise  in  the  training  data.  High-variance  models  are  more complex and have a higher error on the test set.  Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in a machine-learning model by adding a  penalty  term  to  the  cost  function.  L1  and  L2  regularization  are  two  common  types  of regularization. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, encouraging sparse solutions where some coefficients are set to zero. This type of regularization  is  useful  when  selecting  a  subset  of  important  features  for  prediction.  L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients, which shrinks the  coefficient  values  towards  zero  but  rarely  sets  them  exactly  to  zero.  This  type  of regularization is useful when reducing the effect of irrelevant features on prediction. Both L1 and  L2  regularization  can  reduce  model  complexity  and  prevent  overfitting.  The  optimal regularization parameter needs to be selected by tuning the hyperparameters of the model.
