The subjects this topic explored the fundamentals of logistic and linear regression, including its assumptions, performance indicators, and applications. In order to prevent skewed accuracy estimates, it is crucial to separate a test set from training data. To determine the linear relationship between variables, we also looked at the ideas of covariance and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Understanding these ideas is crucial for creating powerful machine learning models.
