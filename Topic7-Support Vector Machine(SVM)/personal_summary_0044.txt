In this topicâ€™s unit  learnign outcomes we learned about  the major  concepts of modules of model assessment and selection. the basic thing  we need to do here is to divide our data into test and train. Decause we  are not allowed to use our train data for testing purposed. the test data is  also the part of our major data but saperated it so that we can perform  testing on that data and then use our train data for major work purposes.  in other words test data is for testing purposes and train data is for  training purposes as it is clear by their names.  We  learned about  the  linear  regression in this topic. Linear  regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by  fitting a linear equation to the observed data, in other words an equation  that graphs as a straight line. The values obtrained from linear regression  goes along with the line in garaph. In linear regression formulation we  understand that the linear equation should allow and simulate us to study  the relation between two continious variables. we also had a look at linear  classification. in linear clasification we learned about binary class and  multi-class.  Further more I gained the kowledge about logistic regression. logistic  regression is also known as logit model. logistic regression is often used  for classification and predictive analytics. Logistic regression estimates  the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based  on a given dataset of independent variables
