Topic 6 Summary  1.1  How to obtain an unbiased estimate of the accuracy of the trained model The labeled dataset is divided into two separate sets, with data points in the training set used for the learning process and data points in the test set used to evaluate the learned model, usually in terms of accuracy.  1.2  Relevance and Covariance among features or variables Covariance measures the linear relationship between variables  1.3  Linear regression formulation Linear equations study the relationship between two continuous (quantitative) variables.  1.4  Linear classification Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the output values of the feature vectors are binary. Logistic regression Classification is intrinsically non-linear. So two approaches are generally available: Ignore non-linearity Using link function  1.5  Generalization and complexity Training a logistic regression model means using training data to estimate the regression coefficient vector. If we can derive a closed form formula for the minimiser (e.g. linear regression) we can compute the minimiser in one step. If there is no closed form formula, we must take multiple steps iteratively to reach to the minimum. (eg. logistic regression and Kmeans)  1.6  Model complexity Over-fitting can occur if the model is too complex, and under-fitting can occur if it is too simple.  1.7  Regularised linear models Regularisation increases bias in our model but it greatly reduces the variance.  1.8  Linear regression for feature selection Principal  component  analysis  (PCA),  correlation-based  feature  selection,  and  recursive  feature elimination are typical feature selection methods. To find the most significant features in a dataset, linear regression can be used as a feature selection strategy.  1.9    Regularised linear regression and logistic regression in python
