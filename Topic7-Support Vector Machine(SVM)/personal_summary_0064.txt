This topic we learned about how the performance of machine learning algorithms is measured and compared. We saw how to use python for model assessment and selection, examples of Linear Regression, Linear Classification, Logistic Regression and regularized linear regression in Python. We saw multiples examples of all types of models and how generalization and complexity play an important role in getting the right information out of the model
