Linear Regression – To perform linear regression we find the cost function and then can use in the case of linear regression the normal function which when derived we can find the local minimum. This local minimum matches to optimal weights for the linear regression function. Logistic Regression – logistic regression is a classification algorithm that minimises a cost function to find weights to assign new data samples with like classes. Different to the linear regression we use gradient descent to determine optimal weights.    Regression Metrics.  o  For linear regression problems we can use the mean squared error value or the  explained variance (r2 coefficient) to determine the effectiveness of those models. o  For logistic regression classification problems we can use metrics such as accuracy,  precision, recall and f1 score .
