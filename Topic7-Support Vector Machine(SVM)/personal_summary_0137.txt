1. Download and read the "Real estate valuation data set.xlsx" dataset from the UCI repository. You can find the description of the features and targets on the UCI repository website. Split the dataset in train and test set (use your choice of splitting). Train a linear regression model and report the performance (use your choice of at least four performance metrics).  2. Apply PCA on the dataset and select the first three principal components. Split the dataset into train and test using the same method used in Q1. Compare the performance of this model with the performance obtained in Q1. Explain the outcome.  The accuracy of the model after regularization has been increased from 0.9473 to 0.9736.  L1 and L2 regularization are used to overcome overfitting problem, by allowing amount of error, which is determined by the alpha.
