Reﬂec(cid:415)on:  Task 6.1P  This  topic  I  learned  about  relevance  and  covariance,  linear  regression,  linear  classiﬁca(cid:415)on, generalisa(cid:415)on and complexity, regularised linear models.  Let’s talk about above men(cid:415)oned topics brieﬂy.  Relevance  measures  the  rela(cid:415)onship  between  a  feature  and  the  target  variables  and  on  the  other hand, the covariance measures the rela(cid:415)onship between two features or variables in the dataset.  Pearson’s Correla(cid:415)on Coeﬃcient: This is another interes(cid:415)ng measurement which is used to measure the linear correla(cid:415)on between two variables. It has value between +1 and -1. 1 shows total posi(cid:415)ve correla(cid:415)on, 0 shows no linear correla(cid:415)on, and the -1 shows total nega(cid:415)ve linear correla(cid:415)on.  Linear regression: The linear regression is a kind of model that shows the linear rela(cid:415)onship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variable. It assumes that the rela(cid:415)onship between the dependent variable and independent variables is linear i.e., one independent variable is directly propor(cid:415)onal to dependent variable.  Linear classiﬁca(cid:415)on: This is a type of classiﬁca(cid:415)on model that aims to separate data into two or more classes using linear decision boundary.  Logis(cid:415)c regression: This is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the output values of the feature vectors are binary.  Generalisa(cid:415)on refers to the ability of trained model to accurately predict on new, unseen data that was not used during the model training process.  Complexity: Model complexity of linear models increase with the number of features. We should be aware of model complexity especially if we have a limited set of training data. The reason is the risk of over-ﬁ(cid:427)ng on this limited set of training data.  Regularised  linear  models:  A  regulariser  is  an  addi(cid:415)onal  term  in  the  loss  func(cid:415)on  to  avoid  the overﬁ(cid:427)ng. It is called a regulasier since it tries to keep the parameters more normal or regular. We have two types of regularised linear models i.e., L1 Lasso regularisa(cid:415)on and L2 Ridge regularisa(cid:415)on.
