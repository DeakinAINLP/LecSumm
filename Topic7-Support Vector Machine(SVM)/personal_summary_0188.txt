  Linear regression is used to model a relationship by using a linear equation  Logistic regression is used when the output is binary  The complexity of a model increases as more features are added  The logistic function is used for logistic regression  The logistic function is also called the sigmoid function  Logistic regression uses training data to calculate the regression coefficient vector  Regularisation is used to reduce over fitting on a model which improves performance  Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too used to the training data so that it cannot  predict efficiently anymore   Underfitting is when the model does not fit the data well
