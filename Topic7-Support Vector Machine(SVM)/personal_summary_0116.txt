In this topic explored the supervised learning, different type of regression (linear regression and  logistic  regression  model),  model  complexity  and  regulariser  L1  and  L2.    About  the relationship dependent variable and class label. By using the linear regression model to find out what is the best line can be estimated or found and do the evaluation for the training set. And if facing the overfitting and underfitting, we can use the approaches of L1 norm and L2 in terms of the regularizer.
