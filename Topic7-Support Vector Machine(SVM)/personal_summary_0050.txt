 In topic six of the course, we studied supervised learning and its various forms, such as regression and logistic regression. The lecture focused on understanding the relationship between feature variables, the difference between generalisation and memorisation, model complexity, and evaluation metrics. We also learned about sci-kit processes in Python, which allowed us to implement linear and logistic regression on train data, evaluate on test data, and model the log of odds based on input. Overall, the lecture provided us with a deep understanding of linear and logistic regression.
