Topic 6 Key Learning Points I have captured the key learning points for myself as the following:  Assessing a trained model:    Relevance between the features of the model:    Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient  Linear hypothesis  So how can we find the line? The line has two parameters. W, the slope of the line, and b, the y intercept of the line. If we have these two parameters, we can use them to find our straight line.      Reducing the loss function (enabling to reduce Imperial risk):  -> Why w? We are trying to the w, therefore we need to take the derivative to w.  Linear Classification       Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the output values of the feature vectors are binary.  Like all regression analyses, logistic regression is a predictive analysis. Before talking about logistic regression, let's first review linear classification.    Binary Classification   Multiclass Classification  It seems that we need another function such as a decision function q(ℎ(x)) which uses a fixed non-linear link function and projects the value of ℎ(x) into [0,1] interval.          Regularised linear models  A regulariser is an additional term in the loss function to avoid overfitting. It is called a regulariser since it tries to keep the parameters more normal or regular. In other words, it does not allow regression coefficients (or weights) to take excessively large values. What will happen if one or more weights are excessively large? It implies your model is highly dependent on that one feature.
