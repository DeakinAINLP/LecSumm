Linea regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.  The measure of the Linea relationship between the possibly multi-dimensional variable X and output Y is done using covariance.  Pearson’s correlation coefficient is a measurement of the correlation between 2 variables, this tells us how strongly related they are or if they are related at all.  Classification problems fall into one of two categories, binary (is something or isn’t) and multi-class (what kind of thing is it)  Linea classification is when the separation boundary between two classes is linear.  When training linear regression, unseen data is used to compare predicted output with truth by comparing the two we can evaluate the performance of the model.  The logistic function is S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 1 and 0.  Training a logistic regression model is the process of training data in order to estimate the regression coefficient vector.  Sometimes a model can perform poorly due to two factors.  Underfitting, where the model does a poor job of understanding the training data.  Overfitting. Where the model is too specific to the training data and doesn’t provide the flexibility to work with other data.  Being aware of both pitfalls allows us to fit the model loosely enough to not suffer from either problem.  A regulariser is a value that is used to avoid over-fitting, it allows for a model to work given a certain threshold of noise within a training dataset.
