Topic 6 Summary Notes – Linear Model    Linear regression is a method that tries to demonstrate the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line in a graph. Pearson’s correlation coefficient is another measurement which shows the linear correlation between two different variables and shows whether there is positive linear correlation, no correlation or negative linear correlation based on the value between negative 1 and positive 1.    The linear equation is y = h(x) = wx + b, we can find the line as long as we have the two        parameters which are the slope of the line (w) and the y intercept (b) If there are only two outputs given a set of training data it will be considered a binary classification problem, if there are more values than 2 then it will be a multi-class classification problem. It is important to note that linear models will incrementally get more complex as the number of features grows. This could result in over-fitting or under-fitting depending on the situation. Logistic regression doesn’t model y in terms of x but rather it models the logit value which is also called the log of odds based on x.    6.8 goes over training a logistic regression model, this is the act of using training data to get an estimate of the regression coefficient vector, w. Maximum likelihood estimation can be used to figure out the w.    6.10 shows model complexity and reasons why over-fitting and under-fitting occur. For  under-fitting this can occur due to a very simple model or if we use a linear model when the data needs a non-linear model. Over-fitting occurs when the model complexity is on the high end of the spectrum. Also models with very little parameters are inaccurate due to large bias therefore causing under-fitting and too many parameters cause a large variance resulting in over-fitting.    We are introduced to a regulariser in the loss function which can assist in avoiding  overfitting. It works by reducing or keeping parameter values more normal, so it is easier to model.    The main libraries we will be using in Python regarding this topic are: sklearn.linear_model  Ridge and Lasso
