This topic provided an in-depth coverage of supervised learning and particularly linear and logistic regression problems. We started by exploring relevance and covariance amongst features with Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient.  We looked at linear regression formulation and how we can fit a hypothesis on a data set. We also looked at logistic regression for making classification decisions.  We learned about logistic regression formulation and how to train a model and test the efficiency.  We also explored model complexity including underfitting and overfitting and the role that bias and variance can play on the performance and how they need to be balanced.  We conclude the theory component by looking at regularisation across liner and logistic regression models.  The second part of the topic focused on the use of the Python programming language and how it can be used in order to perform regularized linear and logistic regression.
