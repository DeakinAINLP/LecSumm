 The topics that were covered during topic 6 were concepts focusing on model assessment and selection, linear regression, linear classification, logistic regression with examples, regularized linear models. Then, regularized linear regression and logistic regression in python.  I referred to the unit site contents for learning the topics that were covered in topic 6 along with the external video links and articles provided.  The learning journey started with the basics of understanding how to access a trained model, relevance, and covariance among the variables. Then, I acquired knowledge about linear regression along with examples, formulation of linear regression. I gained an idea on the concept of linear classification ,logistic regression with two general approaches like ignore non-linearity and using link function. Then, I gathered knowledge about generalization and model complexity of linear regression. Then, learnt about linear regression formulation , what are the odds and testing the model. Later, got an overview of training a logistic regression model, logistic loss function, iterative optimizing. Then, learnt about examples of logistic regression, model complexity , under-fitting/ over-fitting, bias variance decomposition, variance bias trade off, regularised linear models, regularisation impact, L1 regularisation(LASSO), L2 regularisation(Ridge), linear regression for feature selection. Finally, I acquired knowledge on implementation of regularised linear regression using python program in which in both L1 and L2 regularised linear regression were covered, logistic regression in python with computation of performance metrics.
