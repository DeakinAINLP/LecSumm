Based on the sixth topic's lecture, implement Linear regression, classification, and logistic regression, training them, and determining the relevance and covariance among variables or features such as Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. Then there's the model complexity, which rises as the number of features grows, which can lead to issues like underfitting. Using MSE (Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to predict the unknown data. I also tried Gradient Descent optimization using a variety of initializations.
