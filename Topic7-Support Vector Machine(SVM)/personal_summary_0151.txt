Covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. It measures how much two variables change together. If the greater values of one variable mainly correspond with the greater values of the other variable, and the same holds for the lesser values, the covariance is positive. If the greater values of one variable mainly correspond with the lesser values of the other variable, the covariance is negative. If there is no relationship between the two variables, the covariance is zero.  The covariance can be normalized to obtain the correlation coefficient, which is a number between - 1 and 1 that measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, a correlation coefficient of - 1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and a correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no linear relationship.  The Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient are two measures of the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the degree of linear relationship between two continuous variables, while the Spearman rank correlation coefficient measures the degree of monotonic relationship between two variables, which may or may not be continuous. The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, a value of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and a value of 0 indicates no linear relationship. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect monotonic relationship, a value of -1 indicates a perfect inverse monotonic relationship, and a value of 0 indicates no monotonic relationship.  Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The formula for a simple linear regression is y = a + bx, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, b is the slope of the line, and a is the y-intercept. The slope of the line represents the change in y for a unit change in x. The y- intercept represents the value of y when x is equal to 0.  Logistic regression is a statistical method used to model the probability of a binary categorical outcome based on one or more independent variables. The logistic model is a statistical model that models the probability of an event taking place by having the log-odds for the event be a linear combination of one or more independent variables.  Regularization is a technique used in regression analysis to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. Regularized regression is a type of regression where the coefficient estimates are constrained to zero. The magnitude of coefficients, as well as the magnitude of the error term, are penalized. Regularization can be achieved by adding a penalty term to the loss function of the regression model. The two most common types of regularization are L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge).
