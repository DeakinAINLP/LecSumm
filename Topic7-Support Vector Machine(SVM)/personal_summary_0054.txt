During  topic  six  of  the  course,  we  focused  on  supervised  learning,  which  includes various  forms,  such  as  regression  problems  and  logistic  regression  problems.  The lecture  covered  the  importance  of  understanding  relevance  and  covariance  among feature  variables,  along  with the  difference  between  generalisation  and memorisation, the complexity of the model, and evaluation metrics. We also learned about  the  sci-kit  processes  in  Python,  which  can  be  used  to  implement  linear  and logistic regression on train data and evaluation on test data and model the log of odds based  on  input.  Overall,  the  lecture  provided  a  deep  understanding  of  linear  and logistic regression.
