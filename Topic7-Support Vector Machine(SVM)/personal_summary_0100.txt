Topic 6: Linear model  6.2 Relevance and Covariance among features or variables  Linear regression is used to map the relationship between two variables. It graphs a straight line through the data points. This line can be used to make predictions.  Correlation Coefficient is a value between +1 and -1 that measures the linear relationship between the variables.  Other than linear relationships there is also curvilinear relationship which is depicted by something other than a straight line.  6.4 Linear regression formulation  Here is the equation for the straight line:  Where w = the gradient and b = the y intercept.  The goal is to find m and b that minimized the total maximum error. yi is observed value and y^ is predicted value.  I.e., predicted y = mx + b.  The equation on the left of the image above solves the issue where the variables are explained on the right side. This is understood by me as I have dealt with this in years prior.  6.5 Linear classification  Logistic regression is used when the output values of the features are binary.
