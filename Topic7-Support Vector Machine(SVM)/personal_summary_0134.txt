This topic, I have studied the linear model. I have seen relevance and covariance among features. I finally understood Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient which I have superficially seen in another unit. I have also consolidated my knowledge about linear and logistic regressions, and linear regression which I have also studied before. I have studied about generalization which I have also seen (MSE and R^2) in another unit, and complexity. I have studied how to estimate the regression coefficient vector by using training data and logistic loss function. I understood how to compute minimums and iterative optimizing. I have learned model complexity along with over-fitting and under-fitting concepts and the calculation of risk by using bias, variance, and noise. I understood the regularization concept, the effect of regularization on weights, the importance of regularization by reduction of variance, and how it is used in linear models. As I understood from the video at the end of the learning content 6.11, regularization also helps not to have too much error while keeping small parameter values. I have learned that linear regression can be used for feature selection. I skimmed the paper ‘Chen, Xiaojun, et al. "Semi-supervised Feature Selection via Rescaled Linear Regression." IJCAI. Vol. 2017. 2017’ and learned that authors have found a method called Rescaled Linear Regression and they can use this method on both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the feature selection process.
