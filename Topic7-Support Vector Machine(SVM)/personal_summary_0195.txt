 The linear link between two variables is measured by the Pearson's correlation coefficient. There are three possible values for this scale: -1 for a perfect negative correlation, 0 for no correlation, and 1 for a perfect positive correlation. The relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables can be modelled using the machine learning technique known as linear regression. Finding a linear relationship between the independent factors and the dependent variable is the aim of linear regression. Data categorization into predetermined categories or classes is the aim of the supervised learning technique known as linear classification in machine learning. In linear classification, the data are divided into various classes using a linear model. In machine learning, generalization refers to a model's capacity to perform well on untried data. Building a model that generalizes successfully, or that can generate reliable predictions on novel, unforeseen data, is the aim of machine learning.  For binary classification issues, a sort of linear model called logistic regression is used. The logit function, used in the formulation of logistic regression, converts the result of a linear equation into a probability value between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood of a binary event. In order to train a logistic regression model, a training dataset is used to estimate the model's parameters or coefficients. The inaccuracy or misclassification of the model is frequently assessed using the logistic loss function. Regularisation is a strategy that involves adding a penalty term to the loss function during training, which discourages complexity and penalises big coefficients or parameters. Ridge regression and LASSO are two often employed techniques for regularisation.
