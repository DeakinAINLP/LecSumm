This topic's study on linear and logistic models in machine learning was insightful. I learned the relevance and covariance among features and how they impact feature selection. Additionally, I was able to understand linear regression, which is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear classification, which is a supervised learning technique for predicting class based on features, was also covered. Generalization and complexity in designing machine learning models were highlighted. The study also delved into logistic regression, a technique used for binary classification problems. We also covered how to train a logistic regression model using gradient descent and evaluated its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The concept of regularized linear models was also introduced as a means of preventing overfitting and improving generalization.
