Topic 6 is all about regression, this topic I studied 2 regression models: linear and logistic along with their  mathematical  equations,  the  physical  significance  of  functions  used  along  with  the  steps regarding how models get trained and how cost function is optimised for these algorithms.  Reading List In  the  initial  modules  6.1  to  6.4,  details  regarding  covariance  among  variables,  a  linear  regression example, and its formulation is explained and in 6.5 classification using linear regression is mentioned. From 6.7 we dive into logistic regression starting with its formula and then training a model and an example in modules 6.8 and 6.9 respectively.  From 6.10 to 6.12 we discuss model complexity, regularization of linear models and feature selection. At last, in 6.13 and 6.14 we cover python implementation of linear and logistic regression respectively.
