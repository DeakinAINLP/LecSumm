 Topic -6 gave the details of the basics of liner model under supervised learning. Some of the  important points are listed below:  1.  Relevance and covariance among features or variables are important considerations in  linear regression, which models the relationship between two variables using a linear  equation that represents a straight line [1].  2.  Pearson's Correlation Coefficient is  a useful measure to assess the linear correlation  between two variables, providing insights into their relationship [2].  3.  Linear  classification  refers  to  a  group  of  methods  used  to  separate  data  points  into  distinct classes or categories based on a linear combination of input features [2].  4.  In linear classification, a decision boundary or hyperplane is used to divide the feature  space into different regions, each representing a specific class. The goal is to find the  best  hyperplane  that  separates  the  data  points  with  the  highest  margin  or  minimal  classification error [3].  5.  A good linear regression model should be able to generalize well to new data points,  capturing the underlying relationship between the independent and dependent variables  [4].  6.  The complexity of the  model is  determined by  the number and type of  independent  variables, as well as any transformations or interactions between them [4].  7.  The  logistic  loss  function  is  a  cost  function  used  in  logistic  regression  and  other  classification algorithms that output probabilities. It is used to measure the difference  between the predicted probabilities and the true class labels [4].    8.  Regularization adds a penalty to the cost function, discouraging the model from relying  too heavily on any single feature or having excessively large coefficients. This results  in a simpler model that generalizes better to unseen data [5].
