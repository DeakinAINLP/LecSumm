Topic 6 Summary Linear Model  Linear regression: Models relationship between 2 variables by fitting a linear equation through  observed data  For each data point (feature vector) "xi", there is an output "yi".  Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient  measure of the linear correlation between two variables,x& y  value between 1& 1  1 indicates total positive linear correlation  0is no linear correlation   1total negative linear correlation.  Linear regression formulation  w: slope of the line b: intercept to y axis  Model Complexity  y = h(x) = wx + b  Under-fitting:  may be using linear model, instead of non-linear model  short number of variables  Over-fitting:  fits exactly against training data  Variance bias trade off  Linear regression for feature selection  Finds most significant features in dataset  Principal component analysis  PCA   Correlation-based feature selection  Recursive feature elimination  Use of Linear regression for feature selection is to evaluate strength of relationship between each feature & target variable
