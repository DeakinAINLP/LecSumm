Topic 6 Notes    Assessing a trained model  Divide dataset into training set and test set. The training set is used for the learning process and the points in test set are utilised for assessing the learned model, in terms of accuracy.    Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data, that is an equation that graphs as a straight line.  Training data and test data is of the form of xi, yi, I = 1,2…,n. For each data point (feature vector) xi, there is an output yi    Covariance is used to measure linear relationship between variable x and output y    Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient measures the linear correlation between two variables, x  and y. Coefficient value of 1 = total positive linear correlation, 0 =no linear correlation, and -1 = total negative linear correlation. Linear regression line  Linear classification, two outputs = binary classification and more outputs = multi-class classification problems.  Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the output values of the feature vectors are binary. Formulation is based on logistic function/sigmoid function:    NOTE: Least squares regression can perform very badly when some points in the training data  have excessively large or small values
