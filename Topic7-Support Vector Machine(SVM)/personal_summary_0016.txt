Two linear machine learning models were covered in this topics module, Linear Regression (to predict numerical values) and Logistic Regression (to classify data). We looked at how linear regression tries to predict values by calculating weights for every feature through the Moore- Penrose pseudo-inverse. We covered the theory of logistic regression in the binary classification case, and how it classifies based on logits utilising linear regression. While training a logistic regression model, estimates for the regression coefficient vector (w) are found minimising the Logistic Loss function. The solution for this can be closed form if the Logistic Loss function has a single point with a derivative of 0, but it is possible for this problem to have no solutions or many solutions instead. When there are multiple solutions a global minimum may be found using Gradient Descent or Newtonâ€™s method.
