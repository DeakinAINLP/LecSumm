In this topic we cover Training a model is something that learns what values should be selected for all the weights and the bias from labeled examples. The performance can be measured using the Pearson Correlation to create a sample correlation coeﬃcient that shows the strength and direction of linear relationships between pairs of continuous variables.  The training model Logistic regression is where we get a value as output, and we want to model the conditional probability where any unknown parameters in the function are to be estimated by maximum likelihood.  TASK REFLECTION  2.Apply PCA on the dataset and select the ﬁrst three principal components. Split the dataset into train and test using the same method used in Q1. Compare the performance of this model with the performance obtained in Q1. Linear Regression  The performance for the training dataset shows that the max error score and RMSE of PCA is lower than Linear regression.  4.Apply L1 or L2 regulariser on the logistic regression model developed using the same train and test data used in Q3 and calculate performance of the new model. Compare performance of this model with the performance reported in Q3. Explain the outcome.  Logistic Regression returned RMSE of 0.2581988897471611, R2 score of 0.893048128342246 , a max error score of 0 and explained variance score of  1.0 for the testing dataset. The training dataset had RMSE 0.0, R2 score 1.0, max error score 0 and explained variance score 1.0.  I will use the information in this module to load datasets from SKlearn and Split the dataset in train and test the date using  a linear regression model and report the performance with diﬀerent  performance metrics. I can then apply PCA on the dataset and select the ﬁrst three principal components. Finally, I can Apply L1 or L2 regulariser on the logistic regression model developed using the same train and test data to calculate performance of the new model.
