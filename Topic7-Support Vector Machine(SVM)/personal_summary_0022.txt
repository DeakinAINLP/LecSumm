This topic explores the concept of relevance and covariance among features or variables in a dataset. Relevant features are those that are important for a particular task, while irrelevant features are those that do not contribute significantly to the task. Covariance measures the extent to which two variables vary together. In machine learning, it is important to identify relevant features and reduce the dimensionality of the data to avoid overfitting and improve the performance of the models. Example of Linear Regression  Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables. This topic provides an example of linear regression, where the goal is to predict the salary of employees based on their years of experience. Linear regression formulation  tual output values. Linear classification  Linear classification is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict a categorical output variable based on one or more input variables. This topic covers the basics of linear classification and the mathematical formulation of linear classifiers, such as logistic regression.  Generalisation and complexity  In machine learning, the goal is to build models that can generalize well to new, unseen data. This topic covers the concept of generalization and how it is affected by the complexity of the model. A more complex model may have better performance on the training data, but may not generalize well to new data. Logistic regression formulation  Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict a binary output variable based on one or more input variables. This topic covers the mathematical formulation of logistic regression and the sigmoid function, which is used to map the output to a probability value between 0 and 1.  Training a logistic regression model:  This topic covers the process of training a logistic regression model using gradient descent. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that is used to find the values of the model parameters that minimize the cost function. Logistic regression example:  This topic provides an example of logistic regression, where the goal is to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on their age and income.  Model complexity  Model complexity is an important consideration in machine learning. A more complex model may have better performance on the training data, but may not generalize well to new data. This topic covers the concept of model complexity and how it can be controlled using regularization.  Regularized linear models  Regularized linear models are used to control the complexity of a model and prevent overfitting. This topic covers the two most regularization used in linear models: L1 regularization (lasso) and L2 regularization (ridge regression). Linear regression for feature selection  common types of : Linear regression can be used for feature selection, where the goal is to identify the most important features for a particular task. This topic covers the concept of feature selection using linear regression and the use of regularization to prevent overfitting.  Regularized linear regression in Python
