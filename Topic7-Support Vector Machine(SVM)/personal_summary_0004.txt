This module covered Logistic and Linear regression and when each would be  suitable for a given problem. Logistic would be the better choice when the decision is categorical or binary estimating the probability of an outcome based on one or more variables. Whereas Logistic regression  is  better  suited  when  the  dependant  variable  is  continuous  and  the  goal  is  to measure the linear relationship, such as house prices that we covered in the task.
