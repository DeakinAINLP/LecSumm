The aim of supervised learning is to learn a mapping between the input features and the target labels so that the model can accurately predict the labels for new, unseen data.  Model Assessment and Selection  Model assessment involves evaluating the performance of a machine learning model on a test set to see how well it can generalize to new, unseen data. Model selection involves choosing the best model  from  a  set  of  candidate  models  based  on  their  performance  on  a  validation  set.  When selecting the best model, it is important to consider several factors, such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the accuracy of the predictions.  Relevance and Covariance Among Features or Variables  Relevance refers to the degree to which a feature or variable is related to the target variable, while covariance  refers  to  the  degree  to  which  two  variables  are  related  to  each  other.  In  machine learning, it is important to consider both relevance and covariance among features when selecting features for a model, as highly correlated or irrelevant features can negatively impact the model's performance. Additionally, it is important to consider the interaction between the features, as some features may have a stronger impact on the target variable when combined with other features.  Linear Regression  Linear  regression  is  a  supervised  learning  algorithm  used  to  model  the  relationship  between  a continuous target variable and one or more predictor variables. The aim of linear regression is to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes the relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable. Linear regression can be used for many applications, such as predicting the price of a house based on its features, or predicting the number of sales based on marketing spend.  Linear Classification  Linear classification is a type of supervised learning algorithm used to classify data into two or more classes. The aim of linear classification is to find the best-fitting linear equation that separates the data into different classes. Linear classification is commonly used in applications such as spam detection, fraud detection, and image classification.  Logistic Regression  Logistic regression is a type of linear classification algorithm used to model the probability of an event occurring based on one or more predictor variables. The aim of logistic regression is to find the best-fitting S-shaped curve that describes the relationship between the predictor variables and the probability of the event occurring. Logistic regression can be used for many applications, such as predicting the probability of a customer churning based on their past behavior, or predicting the probability of a patient having a disease based on their symptoms.  Generalisation and Complexity  Generalisation refers to the ability of a machine learning model to accurately predict the target variable  for  new,  unseen  data.  To  achieve  good  generalisation  performance,  it  is  important  to balance the complexity of the model with its ability to accurately capture the underlying patterns in the data. More complex models may be able to capture more complex relationships in the data, but may also be more prone to overfitting and poor generalisation. Therefore, it is important to use techniques such as cross-validation and regularization to ensure good generalisation performance.  Regularised Linear Models  Regularised linear models are linear models that have been modified to include a regularisation term that penalises large coefficients in the model. Regularisation can help to prevent overfitting and  improve  generalisation  performance.  There  are  several  types  of  regularisation,  such  as  L1 regularization (also known as Lasso) and L2 regularization (also known as Ridge).  Linear Regression and Logistic Regression in Python  Linear regression and logistic regression can be implemented in Python using popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, and TensorFlow. These libraries provide pre- built  functions  and  classes  for  building  and  training  linear  regression  and  logistic  regression models on data. Additionally, there are many online resources and tutorials available for learning how to use these libraries, making it easy for anyone to get started with machine learning.
