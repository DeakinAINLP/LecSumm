In topic 6, we looked at model assessment and selection, namely a linear regression model and a logistic regression model. We covered how these different models operate and the different use cases of them, including when to use which model. We continued to further develop our ability to train and test data in order to get an accurate prediction from our algorithms. While discussing and learning about the different regression models, we also covered the topic of logic, log of odds, which shares similarities to linear regression.
