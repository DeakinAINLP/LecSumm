I confirm that I have successfully achieved the below-mentioned learning goals.  1.  Relevance and covariance among features or variables 2.  Linear regression formulation 3.  Linear classification 4.  Generalization 5.  Complexity 6.  Logistic regression formulation 7.  Training a logistic regression model 8.  Model Complexity 9.  Regularized linear models.  I was not familiar with any of these concepts at all. So, it was very interesting and exciting to learn about a new side of machine learning. And the practical part done with Python was new to me as well. Once I read through the theory, watched the attached videos and the lecture and some resources from the internet, I was able to grasp the theories well.
