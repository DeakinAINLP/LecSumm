topic 6 covered relevance and covariance amogn features or variables simplified as the importance of each feature in making predictions covariance how features change together which helps to understand relationships useful for feature selection and reducing complexity linear regression used for predicting continuous value based on input y = mx + b (slope intercept form of a linear equation) finds best fitting of a line linear classification separating data into classes uses a straight line to divide groups ie linear generalisation and complexity generalisation a models ability to work with new data complexity how many features and interactions a model considers theres a balance as simpler models might generalise better and complex models may overfit logistic regression predicting the probabilities of belonging to different classes uses logistic function that outputs values between 0 and 1 good for binary classification
