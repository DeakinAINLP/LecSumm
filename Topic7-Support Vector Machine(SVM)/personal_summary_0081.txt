Topic 6 Liner model  Liner model Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data, in other words, an equation that graphs as a straight line.  Relevance and Covariance among features or variables Relevance and covariance among features or variables are crucial concepts. Covariance measures how closely two variables are related to one another, whereas relevance measures how much a feature or variable contributes to the prediction of the target variable. In addition to assisting in feature selection, understanding the covariance and relevance of features or variables can help you avoid problems like multicollinearity in linear regression.  Linear regression formulation A common statistical technique for simulating the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables is linear regression. Finding the line or plane that minimises the sum of the squared errors and best fits the data points is the objective of linear regression.  Linear classification Linear classification is a common technique used in machine learning to classify data points into one of two or more categories based on a set of input features. It involves finding a linear decision boundary that separates the data points into different classes.  Generalisation and complexity The ability of a machine learning model to generalize to new, unseen data is critical for its success in real-world applications. However, this is often balanced against the model's complexity, as a model that is too simple may not capture all of the important relationships in the data, while a model that is too complex may overfit and not generalize well.
