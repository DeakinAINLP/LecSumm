 Linear regression problems are problems where you try to find the linear  relationship between two variables. Covariance the amount that any one feature vector can provide information about any target vector. Linear regression is usually formulated by calculating the minimum total square error, which can be done using an equation.  Logistic regression problems are problems where you try to find the classification  of something based on other variables. Logistic regression is calculated using maximum likelihood, where given a certain logistic function, the total probability of each data point falling into the predicted classification is measured. This is iterated until convergence and the highest value is found.
