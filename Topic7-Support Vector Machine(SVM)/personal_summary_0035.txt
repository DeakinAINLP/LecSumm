The key points covered in topic six are:  Linear relationships between the features in the dataset and target.  The stronger the  relationship, the more the impact of the feature on the prediction.  Note that while a strong relationship between feature and target is desired, the features should not be correlated with each other.  Features that are correlated should be removed so that information is not duplicated. In Linear regression, the linear equation, which is and extension to the 2 variable linear equation, is fitted to the data.  The best fit is the line with the lowest error. In Linear classification, the same approach is taken but the distance of the predicted to the actual target is not important.  As long as the prediction is on the correct side of the linear boundary, the prediction is correct. This can be achieved by using a suitable link function such as the sigmoid.  As with other models, linear regression and classification can overfit or underfit the training  data.  Model complexity can be controlled by regularisation.
