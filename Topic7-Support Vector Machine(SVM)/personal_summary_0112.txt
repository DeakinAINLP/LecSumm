Topic 6 Summary  This topic we talk about Linear Model.  Types of Correlations:    Pearson’s Correlation Coeﬃcient: It is the measure of linear relationship between 2  variables.  Linear Classiﬁcation: The separation between classes by using a linear boundary line.  Logistic regression: This is the process of regressing by applying a ﬁxed non-linear link function to the main function to obtain classiﬁed results. In training a logistic regression model, we can use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the regression coeﬃcients.    Logit function (log of odds) is used as a link function for an example of logistic  regression.    The minimum of the logistic loss functions if found to ﬁnd the best logistic regression  model.  Bias Variance Decomposition: Method of expressing the risk of the model in terms of its bias, variance, and noise.  Regulariser: It is an additional term added to the logistic loss function to avoid overﬁ(cid:427)ng by making sure that none of the regression coeﬃcients are overly large relative to the others. It is called regulariser since it tries to keep the parameters regular.    1st norm: This type of regulariser encourages 0 weights.  o  This is added to the logistic loss function to create the LASSO regression  analysis method.    2st norm: This type of regulariser penalizes large weights.  o  This is added to the logistic loss function to create the Ridge regression  analysis method.
