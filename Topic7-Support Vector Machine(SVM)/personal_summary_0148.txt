This topic’s content was focused on concepts pertaining to model assessment and selection which covered various aspects of linear regression and logistic regression, training and testing linear/ logistic regression models.  ● Linear regression is used to understand and analyze the relationship between two  continuous variables. In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, the equation of a simple linear regression model can be expressed as:  y = ax + b (In this case y is the dependent variable and x is independent variable) b is the y-intercept a is the slope  The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line.  To find the best-fitting line, we need to estimate the values of b and a. We do this by minimizing the difference between the observed data points and the values predicted by the line.  ● Logistic regression is a method used to predict whether something belongs to one  category or another. Instead of drawing a straight line like in linear regression, logistic regression is defined by a curve called the sigmoid function. Which can be given as :  𝑃  =  1+ 𝑒  1 −(𝑎 +𝑏𝑋)  ●  Train a logistic regression model: To train a logistic regression model we first split the data into a training set and a test set. Next, define the logistic regression model with the appropriate features, then we determine an optimization algorithm, like gradient descent, to optimize the model's coefficients. Following that, we train the model by passing the training data through it and adjusting the coefficients iteratively and evaluate the model's performance using the test/validation set and relevant metrics. We then use the trained model to make predictions.
