Topic summary  This topic was about understanding supervised learning algorithms and their model appraisal techniques. It involved Linear and logistic regression models and ways to ensure model isn’t over or underfitting. Some focus points were:  -  Performance matrixes –  -  We looked at model assessment and selection.  -  Correlation, linear relationship between two variables and their strength  -  Linear regression, logistic regression and their formulas, linear classification and logistic regression.  o  Logistic regression is used for classification where as linear reg is not  -  Training the linear and logistic regressions , ways to avoid overfitting using RLM  -  Linear reg as feature selection instead of PCA
