This topic mainly talks about Linear Regression  and Logistic Regression. First, it talks about relevant mathematical concepts which are used later. The first mentioned concepts are Relevance and Covariance. Then it introduces an example and formulas of Linear Regression. Thereafter, it introduces Logistic regression which is used as linear classifier. Then it elaborates on their generalisation and complexity. Subsequently, it specifies how to training a logistic regression model. It later focuses on the relationship between variance and bias as well as Regularised linear models, in which the separate  formulas and impacts of them(i.e., LASSO and Ridge)  are described in detail. Then it talks about how to use python to implement Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. During the study, I mainly references the videos given in the slides and answers given by the Bing Chat. What impressed me most is the effects of L1 and L2 penalties, because it can nicely handle the collinearity issue which is commonly happens in practical work.
