Summarise the main points that is covered in this topic.  a) Covariance - measures the amount of information a  specific xi provide for yi  b) Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient - a measure of the linear  correlation between two variables  c) A curvilinear relationship - a relationship between two or  more variables  d) w = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T y, looking for proper w (minimize MSE)  to fit the line on feature vectors  e) a decision function theta(h(x)), using non-linear link  functions, projects the value of h(x) into [0,1] interval  f) Overly complex model brings over-fitting
