 Types of Correlations:    Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient: Measure of linear relationship between 2 variables.  Linear Classification: The process of separating classes by using a linear boundary line.  Logistic regression: This type of regression is the process of regressing by applying a non-linear link function to the main function to obtain classified results.     Logit function (log of odds) is used as a link function for an example of logistic regression. In training a logistic regression model, we can use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the regression coefficients.    The minimum of the logistic loss functions if found to find the best logistic regression model.  o  Gradient descent is used to iteratively find the minimum.  Bias Variance Decomposition: Method of expressing the risk (underfitting or overfitting) of the model in terms of its bias, variance, and noise.  Regulariser: It is an additional term added to the logistic loss function to avoid overfitting by making sure that none of the regression coefficients are overly large relative to the others.    1st norm: This type of regulariser encourages 0 weights.  o  This is added to the logistic loss function to create the LASSO regression analysis  method.    2st norm: This type of regulariser penalizes large weights.  o  This is added to the logistic loss function to create the Ridge regression analysis  method.
