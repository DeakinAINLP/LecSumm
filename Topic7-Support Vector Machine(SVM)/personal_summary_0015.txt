Topic  six  was  a  more  specialised  topic  focusing  on  Linear  and  Logistic  regression.  We  briefly  began  with  Linear Regression, some methods for identifying when this model is appropriate to use and reviewed model complexity and its  effect  on  a  Linear  Regression  model.  We  then  moved  to  Logistic  Regression  and  its  fundamental  concept.  We explored some examples, its use cases and benefits. Finally, we covered regularisation methods before diving the Python code and application.
