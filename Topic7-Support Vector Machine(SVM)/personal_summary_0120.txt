 In topic 6 of my machine learning course, I have gained a thorough understanding of linear models, which serve  as the  foundation for numerous machine learning algorithms and are frequently  utilized  in  a  variety  of  applications  due  to  their  readability  and  simplicity. Understanding  relevance  and  covariance  among  features, linear classification, logistic regression, model generalization and complexity, and regularised linear models are just a few of the many facets of linear models that were covered in this topic's material.  linear  regression,  To understand the relationships between the input characteristics and how they affect model performance,  we  started  the  topic  by  talking  about  the  Relevance  and  Covariance  among features or variables. We discovered that figuring out and controlling these interactions can result in superior feature choice and model performance.  The next area of investigation was the Linear Regression formulation, which entails developing a linear hypothesis that best explains the relationship between input data and output labels. We  looked  at  the  fundamentals  of  linear  regression,  including  how  to  minimize  the  least squares that fit the data and the importance of coefficients and intercepts.  Using this information as a foundation, we explored linear classification, where we discovered how to categorize data points using a linear decision boundary. We learned how crucial it is to establish a suitable decision boundary for correct classification and how this paves the way for more sophisticated classification algorithms.  This topic's main subject was logistic regression, a linear model that is frequently used for classification applications. We discovered how the logistic regression model's generalization and  complexity  impact  how  well  it  performs  on  untested  data.  The  Logistic  Regression Formulation subsequently thoroughly explored the process of utilising the logistic function to estimate the likelihood that an input belongs to a particular class.  To minimize the Logistic Loss Function during the training of a Logistic Regression model, we investigated iterative optimization techniques including gradient descent. We can adjust the model's parameters with this optimization to ensure that the predictions made by the model closely match the actual class labels.  comprehending Model Complexity, particularly the ideas of Bias and Variance Decomposition, is  crucial  to  comprehending  linear  models.  We  talked  about  how  these  factors  must  be balanced and how that affects the model's capacity to adapt to new data. To create reliable and accurate models, bias and variance must be balanced properly.  Finally,  we  discussed  regularised  linear models,  which  reduce  model complexity  and  avoid overfitting  by  adding  regularisation  terms  to  the loss  function.  To  promote  more straightforward  and  reliable  solutions,  we  learned  about  L1  regularisation  (LASSO)  and  L2 regularisation  (Ridge),  which  apply  various  penalties  to  the  model's  parameters.  These regularisation methods reduce overfitting by penalizing excessively complicated models and increase the model's capacity to generalize to fresh data.
