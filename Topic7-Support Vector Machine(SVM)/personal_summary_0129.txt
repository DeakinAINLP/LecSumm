➢  Linear Regression : A continuous output variable (also known as the dependent variable) can be predicted using the machine learning approach of linear regression using one or more input factors (also known as independent or predictor variables). It is an easy-to- use approach that is frequently employed in supervised learning.  ➢  Logistic Regression:  Using one or more input variables (also known as independent or predictor variables), logistic regression is a machine learning technique used to forecast a binary output variable (also known as the dependent variable). It is a common form of supervised learning technique for classification issues. Finding a mathematical connection between the input variables and the likelihood that the output variable would take on a specific value (such as 0 or 1) is the aim of logistic regression. Logistic regression, in contrast to linear regression, maps the input values to a value between 0 and 1, using a sigmoid function (also known as a logistic function).  ➢  Model Complexity : A machine learning model's level of sophistication or complexity is  referred to as model complexity, and is often quantified by the number of parameters or features the model uses. In general, a more complicated model contains more parameters or features, which can increase accuracy and power but also make it more prone to overfitting and more difficult to understand.  ➢  Regularised Regression Model: Machine learning methods such as regularised  regression models are used to avoid overfitting in models with a large number of input variables or predictors. Regularised regression models increase the loss function's penalty term, which dissuades the use of excessively high or low parameter values and makes the model easier to understand and more applicable.
