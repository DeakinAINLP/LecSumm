Over  the  past  topic,  I  have  gained  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  several  key topics in the field of machine learning. These include relevance and covariance among features or variables, which can be measured using Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient. I have also learned about linear regression, its formulation, and how it can be used to fit a line to data points. Additionally, I have studied linear classification, which can be either binary or multi-class, and the concept of logistic regression.  I  have  also  explored  the  importance  of  generalisation  in  machine  learning,  which involves making accurate predictions on unseen data, as well as the concept of model complexity  in  linear  regression.  Furthermore,  I have  delved  into the  formulation of logistic regression, including the logit function and how the model can be tested.  I have gained practical experience in training a logistic regression model, including the use of the logistic loss function, iterative optimization, and coordinate-wise gradient descent optimization. I have also learned about the concepts of bias and variance in machine  learning,  including  how  model  complexity  impacts  these  factors  and  the variance bias trade-off.  Another area of focus was regularised linear models, including how regularisers work and their impact on the model. I have studied two types of regularisation techniques, LASSO and Ridge, and learned about their effects on bias and variance.  Finally,  I  have  gained  hands-on  experience  in  implementing  regularised  linear regression and logistic regression models in Python, as well as linear regression for feature  selection.  Overall,  this  past  topic  has  been  a  valuable  learning  experience, providing me with a solid foundation in several key concepts and practical skills in the field of machine learning.
