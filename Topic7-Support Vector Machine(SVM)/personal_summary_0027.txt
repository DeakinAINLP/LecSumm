Covariance: the indicator to show if there is a relationship between 2 variables.  Correlation coefficient: how strong is the relationship between the 2 variables.  Linear Regression: linear approach to find the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable.  w: slope b: y intercept of the line  Fit the line to data points by minimizing the loss:  Linear Classification: linear regression is also used for classification in some cases such as the outputs are binary or multi-class.  Logistic Regression: statistical model use for prediction or classification. The outputs are binary.  Model complexity: -  Overfitting: try to find a complex model to fit the train data, however, test data does  not fit very well.  -  Underfitting: simple model, the test score is very low.  Bias-variance tradeoff: -  Bias: errors between the true values and the predictions. -  Variance: variability of target function response to the change of dataset. -  Low bias or high variance may lead to overfitting. Bias and variance are complement, it is ideal to find the balance between bias and variance.
