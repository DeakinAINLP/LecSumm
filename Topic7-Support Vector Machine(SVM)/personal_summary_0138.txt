The Main points that I’ve covered in the Sixth topic are as follows:  ➢  I have got the knowledge of the statistical approaches towards the algorithm. ➢  I have understood the supervised Machine learning models such as Logistic  regression, Linear regression and classification etc.  ➢  I got familiar with the Model complexity and Generalization.  My Learning summary Based on 6th Topics Lecture getting in depth of supervised learning techniques and implement Linear regression and classification and Logistic regression, training them and Finding the relevance and covariance among variables or features such as Pearsons Correlation Coefficient. And then moving towards the model complexity which increases as the feature increases, and this may cause problems like Underfitting. Predicting the unseen data using MSE (Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). I have also tried a Gradient Descent optimisation with many different initializations.  Knowledge gained with Lecture slides.  In the Overall topic 6 I have gained the Knowledge of different optimizing techniques, Optimizing the Logistic regression using Gradient Descent, computing the minimum and logistic loss function. Similarly For Linear regression and Classification I have tried to fit data points using Pearsons Correlation Coefficient, Finding the best fit line and classifying binary class or multiclass. Finally, after training the data and fitting I have tried Finding the training versus test error b plotting MSE Functions and notices the changes in data. I have learned about Regularization techniques such as Ridge, Lasso and elastic net. This technique improvises the data and prevents from Overfitting.  Hence the Topic Six was very useful and interesting by understanding the concept of advanced approach towards gaining a perfect outcome.
