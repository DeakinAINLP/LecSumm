Topic 6 Summary 1.  Linear Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning and statistics, used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Here are the main points: a.  Goal:  The  primary  goal  of  Linear  Regression  is  to  find  the  best-fit  line  or  hyperplane  that minimizes  the errors  (residuals)  between  the  predicted values  and  the  actual values  of  the dependent variable.  b.  Simple  vs.  Multiple  Linear  Regression:  Simple  Linear  Regression  involves  one  independent variable and one dependent variable, whereas Multiple Linear Regression involves multiple independent variables and one dependent variable.  c.  Coefficient  estimation:  The  Ordinary  Least  Squares  (OLS)  method  is  commonly  used  to estimate  the  coefficients  by  minimizing  the  sum  of  squared  errors  (residuals)  between  the actual and predicted values.  d.  Model  assumptions:  Linear  Regression  makes  several  assumptions,  including  linearity, independence  of  errors,  constant  variance  (homoscedasticity),  normality  of  errors,  and independence of independent variables (no multicollinearity).  e.  Model evaluation: Metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE),  and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the model's performance.  f.  Model  improvement:  Feature  selection,  feature  scaling,  and  regularization  techniques  (L1/Lasso, L2/Ridge, or Elastic Net) can be applied to improve the model performance.  g.  Applications: Linear Regression is used in various fields, such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and  economics,  for  predicting  numerical  outcomes,  identifying  trends,  and  understanding relationships between variables.  2.  Logistic Regression Logistic  Regression  is  a  popular  machine  learning  algorithm  used  for  classification  tasks, particularly binary classification. It predicts the probability of an outcome based on one or more independent variables. Here are the main points: a.  Goal: The primary goal of Logistic Regression is to model the probability of an event occurring  (e.g., success or failure) based on one or more independent variables.  b.  Coefficient  estimation:  Maximum  Likelihood  Estimation  (MLE)  is  used  to  estimate  the  coefficients by finding the values that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.  c.  Model assumptions: Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the logit of the response  and  the  independent  variables,  independence  of  observations,  and  absence  of multicollinearity among independent variables.  d.  Threshold  determination:  To  convert  the  predicted  probabilities  into  class  predictions,  a threshold  is  set  (commonly  at  0.5).  Probabilities  above  the  threshold  are  classified  as  the positive class, and those below are classified as the negative class.  e.  Model evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the Receiver  Operating  Characteristic  (ROC) Curve (AUC-ROC)  are  used  to  evaluate  the  model's performance.  f.  Regularization: Techniques such as L1/Lasso, L2/Ridge, or Elastic Net can be applied to prevent  overfitting and improve model performance.   g.  Applications: Logistic Regression is widely used in various fields, including medical diagnosis, credit  scoring,  marketing,  and  natural  language  processing,  for  binary  and  multi-class classification tasks.  3.  Model Complexity (Bias & Variance) Model complexity refers to the balance between a model's ability to fit the training data and its ability to generalize to unseen data. Two key concepts that help understand model complexity are bias and variance: a.  Bias:  Bias  refers  to  the  error  introduced  by  approximating  a  real-world  problem  using  a simplified model. High bias models make strong assumptions about the underlying data and tend to be oversimplified, leading to underfitting. Underfitting occurs when a model does not capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test datasets.  b.  Variance: Variance refers to the error introduced by a model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance models are overly complex, fitting the noise in the training data and leading to overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training dataset but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.  c.  Bias-Variance  Trade-off:  In  machine  learning,  there  is  often  a  trade-off  between  bias  and variance. Models with low bias and high variance tend to be complex and prone to overfitting, whereas models with high bias and low variance tend to be simple and prone to underfitting. The  goal  is  to  find  a  balance  between  bias and variance  that  minimizes the  total error  and results in a model with optimal generalization performance.  d.  Model  complexity  graph:  A  model  complexity  graph  is  a  visualization  of  the  relationship between model complexity and performance on both training and validation datasets. It can help identify the optimal level of complexity by showing the point where the validation error is minimized.  e.  Techniques to address bias and variance:  a)  Cross-validation: A technique used to assess the model's performance on unseen data by partitioning the dataset into multiple folds and training and testing the model on different subsets of data.  b)  Regularization:  Techniques  like  L1/Lasso,  L2/Ridge,  or  Elastic  Net  can  be  applied  to  reduce model complexity, prevent overfitting, and improve generalization.  c)  Ensemble methods: Techniques such as bagging, boosting, or stacking can help reduce variance by combining the outputs of multiple models to produce a single prediction. d)  Model  selection:  Selecting  models  with  the  right  complexity  that  balance  bias  and variance, considering the amount of data available and the nature of the problem. e)  Feature selection/engineering: Removing irrelevant features or creating new ones can  help improve model performance and reduce variance.  4.  Regulariser (L1 & L2) Regularization  is  a  technique  used  in  machine  learning  to  prevent  overfitting  and  improve  the generalization of models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The two most common types of regularization are L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge): a.  L1 Regularization (Lasso):    L1 regularization adds the sum of the absolute values of the model coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function. L1 regularization is represented as: L = Loss + λ * Σ|βi|, where L is the regularized loss function, Loss is the original loss function, λ is the regularization parameter (also known as the penalty term or shrinkage factor), and βi are the model coefficients. L1  regularization  encourages  sparsity  by  shrinking  some  coefficients  to  zero,  effectively performing feature selection. This can be useful in cases where some features are irrelevant or redundant.  b.  L2 Regularization (Ridge):  L2 regularization adds the sum of the squares of the model coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function. L2  regularization  is  represented  as:  L  =  Loss  +  λ  *  Σ(βi^2),  where  L  is  the  regularized  loss function, Loss is the original loss function, λ is the regularization parameter, and βi are the model coefficients. L2 regularization discourages large coefficients but does not force them to zero. This can help prevent multicollinearity and stabilize model estimates.  c.  Choosing between L1 and L2 Regularization:  L1 regularization is preferred when only a subset of the features is expected to be important or when performing feature selection is desired. L2 regularization is preferred when there is no prior knowledge about feature importance or when all features are expected to contribute to the model.  d.  Regularization parameter (λ):  The  regularization  parameter,  λ,  controls  the  trade-off  between  model  complexity  and regularization. A higher value of λ increases the penalty, leading to more regularization and a simpler model. Conversely, a lower value of λ reduces the penalty, leading to a more complex model. The optimal value of λ can be found using techniques such as cross-validation. Elastic Net:  e.  Elastic Net is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization, which adds both the L1 and L2 penalty  terms to the loss function. Elastic  Net  is  useful  when  there  are  multiple  correlated  features,  as  it  provides  a  balance between  L1  and  L2  regularization  and  can  perform  both  feature  selection  and  coefficient shrinkage. Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2, help improve model generalization by adding a penalty  term  to  the  loss  function,  which  discourages  overly  complex  models  and  reduces overfitting.  5.  Linear regression for feature selection Feature selection is an important step in machine learning to reduce the dimensionality of the data, improve  model  performance,  and  enhance  interpretability.  Linear  regression  can  be  used  for feature selection in the following ways: a.  Correlation  Analysis:  Analyzing  the  correlation  between  independent  variables  and  the dependent variable helps identify significant relationships. Variables with high correlation to    the dependent variable can be considered important features. However, multicollinearity (high correlation  between  independent  variables)  should  also  be  considered,  as  it  can  lead  to unstable estimates.  b.  Stepwise  Selection:  This  method  involves  iteratively  adding  or  removing  features  based  on their  statistical  significance.  The  process  can  be  forward  selection  (starting  with  an  empty model and adding features), backward elimination (starting with a full model and removing features), or a combination of both.  c.  Regularization  Techniques:  L1  (Lasso)  regularization  can  be  used  for  feature  selection  by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating certain features from the model. Lasso forces less important features to have zero coefficients, resulting in a sparse model with a subset of the original features. Elastic Net, a combination of L1 and L2 regularization, can also be used when there are multiple correlated features.  d.  Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): RFE involves fitting the linear regression model multiple times  with  varying  feature  subsets  and  ranking  the  importance  of  features  based  on  their impact on the model performance. Features with the lowest impact are eliminated, and the process is repeated until the desired number of features is reached.  e.  Model-based  Feature  Selection:  By  fitting  the  linear regression  model  with all features and analyzing  the  coefficients,  one  can  identify  the  importance  of  each  feature.  Features  with higher absolute coefficients contribute more to the model's predictions and can be considered important.  f.  Statistical Tests: Methods such as F-test, t-test, or ANOVA can be used to assess the significance of  each  feature  in  the  linear  regression  model.  Features  with  low  p-values  are  considered significant, while those with high p-values can be eliminated.  When using linear regression for feature selection, it is crucial to consider the assumptions of linear regression,  such  as  linearity,  independence  of  errors,  constant  variance  (homoscedasticity), normality of errors, and independence of independent variables (no multicollinearity). Violation of these assumptions can lead to biased or inaccurate results.
