Used to to predict continuous numeric outcomes, by modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  Linear classification:  Used to classify data into discrete categories, such as binary classification (two categories) and multi-class classification (more than two categories).  Logistic regression:  Used for binary and multi-class classification, and to estimate the probability of an event occurring based on the input variables.  Regularized linear models:  Used to balance model complexity and overfitting, including L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.  All of their strengths, limitations and use cases were discussed including model complexities and performance measures.
