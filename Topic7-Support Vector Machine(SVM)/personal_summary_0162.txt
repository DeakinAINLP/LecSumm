Topic 6 Learnings  Linear regression and logistic regression are two widely used algorithms in the field of supervised learning. Both are used for different types of problems, with linear regression being used for predicting continuous numerical values, while logistic regression is used for binary classification problems.  Linear regression is a method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It involves finding the best fit line that describes the relationship between the variables. The goal of linear regression is to minimize the sum of the squared errors between the predicted and actual values. In Python, linear regression can be implemented using the scikit-learn library, which provides functions for fitting and predicting using linear regression.  Logistic regression, on the other hand, is a classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of an event occurring. It involves finding the best fit line that separates the two classes of data. The logistic regression algorithm uses the sigmoid function to map the predicted values to the range of 0 to 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of a particular class. In Python, logistic regression can be implemented using the scikit-learn library, which provides functions for fitting and predicting using logistic regression.  Regularized linear models are variants of linear regression that are used to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and captures noise in the data instead of the underlying patterns. Regularized linear models add a penalty term to the cost function that penalizes complex models, forcing the model to choose simpler solutions. There are two types of regularized linear models: Lasso and Ridge regression. In Python, regularized linear models can be implemented using the scikit-learn library, which provides functions for fitting and predicting using both Lasso and Ridge regression.  In summary, linear regression and logistic regression are widely used supervised learning algorithms for predicting continuous and categorical outcomes respectively. Regularized linear models are used to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization. All of these algorithms can be implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library, which provides functions for fitting and predicting using various regression and classification algorithms.
