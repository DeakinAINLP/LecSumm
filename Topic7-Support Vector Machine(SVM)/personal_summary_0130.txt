The main points that have been covered this topic are regarding logistic and linear regression. A lot of theory was taught about the background to logistic regression and topics such as model complexity, diving into bias and variance. We also learnt about how to implement logistic regression in python. There was also a lot of content on regularisation, and how to implement it. There was also content on the different types of regualarisers, such as L1 and L2.
