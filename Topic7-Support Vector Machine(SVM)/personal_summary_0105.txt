Topic â€“ 6  Linear Regression: Linear Regression model is a supervised learning algorithm is used to identify relationship with a given dataset, having more than one or more independent variable and one dependent variable which is a continuous real number by fitting a linear equation to predict variables for unknown data. It measures relationship between the variables using covariance.  Here it uses covariance where, if covariance between input and output is positive then they have an increasing relationship, i.e., if x increases then y increases. If covariance between input and output is negative then they have decreasing relationship i.e., if x decreases then y decrease. Alternatively, if covariance between input and output is zero then both the input and output are independent.  Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression model is also supervised Machine learning algorithm which is used to identify relationship between more than one independent and dependent variable where the dependent variable is used to discrete categorical variable. Logistic Regression classification is mainly used to predict such variables where the output can be grouped in a set of variables.
