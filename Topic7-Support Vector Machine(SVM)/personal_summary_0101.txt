This topic continued with Linear Regression and moved onto Logistic Regression. It also continued the discussion of model complexity, as well as metrics for evaluating models, as summarised last topic.  Linear Regression  Linear Regression problems are used to predict values based on the values of other variables. Linear regression uses numerical data and aims to plot a linear relationship between the given variables and the dependent variable you are wanting to predict. A very simple example could be to predict house prices based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.  Logistic Regression  Logistic Regression problems on the other hand are used for classification when the target dependent variable is categorical. A very simple example could be classifying an animal as a rabbit or a hare based on the length of its ears.
