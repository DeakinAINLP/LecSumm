 The Main points that I’ve covered in the eighth topic are as follows:  ➢  I have understood the concept of Decision Trees (DT) ➢  The implementation of DT on classification data. ➢  I got the knowledge of Nonparametric method for regression and classification. ➢  I have understood the implementation of KNN and Decision Trees using Python.  My Learning summary Based on 8th Topics Lecture was gaining Knowledge of different K nearest Neighbours techniques and Decision trees, As DT is a Supervised Machine Learning algorithm, and it can be used for classification and mostly preferred for classification data. This algorithm produces significant accuracy compared to other classification algorithms such as logistic regression or SVM. Decision tree is a flow chart like structure in which internal node represents a test on feature and each leaf node represents a class label.  Knowledge gained with Lecture slides.  In the Overall topic 8 I have explored different supervised models and theory of KNN and Decision trees. I have covered the regression trees and implemented the different model complexity and pruning techniques. And for KNN I have learnt the core deciding factor. The implementation of Gini index and entropy and CART. Different  Metrics used for KNN such as Euclidean distance , Manhattan distance and Minkowski distance for evaluating.  Hence the Topic Eighth was very useful and interesting by understanding the concept of KNN and DT Algorithms and I have implemented this algorithm by splitting Dataset in to 50-50% and 70-30%  using cityblock an cosine metrics in task 8.1P.
