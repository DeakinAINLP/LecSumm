This topic's content covered the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and  Decision Trees. KNN is a non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. It involves finding the K closest data points in the training set to the test point and then predicting the label or value based on the majority vote or average of the K neighbors. The Decision Tree algorithm is a tree- based algorithm used for classification and regression. It involves splitting the data based on a set of conditions that result in the maximum information gain or minimum Gini impurity.
