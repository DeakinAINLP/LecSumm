 It is used for both categorical and continuous data   KNN is used to classify data   K represents how many nearest neighbours are used to classify a data point  A validation curve can be used to calculate the optimal K value  A decision tree represents all possible choices and outcomes  Regression trees allow target data to have continuous values  Gini is used to calculate inequality and is a measure of node purity in a tree  Decision tree algorithms include ID3, C4.5 and CART      Pruning allows a tree to be downsized Pre-pruning occurs during the building process Post-pruning occurs after the tree is completed Pruning is used to remove parts of the tree with minimal ability to classify  I learned about K Nearest neighbours and Decision trees. I learned how KNN and decision trees work and what their purpose is. In the python module I learned how to use KNN and decision tree modules. I learned how to use a validation chart to check for optimal K and depth values. I learned how to use KNN and decision trees to train and test data.
