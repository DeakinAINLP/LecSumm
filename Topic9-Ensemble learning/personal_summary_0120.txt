Topic -8 gave the details of the basics of  KNN and decision tree model. Some of the important  points are listed below:  1.  K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for  classification and regression tasks.  2.  KNN is considered a lazy learning algorithm because it does not make any assumptions  about  the  underlying  data  distribution  and  postpones  the  generalization  process  until  prediction time [1].  3.  The choice of the number of neighbors (K) in the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm  depends  on  the  dataset  and  the  specific  problem  at  hand.  There  is  no  one-size-fits-all  answer  to  determine  the  best  value  of  K,  as  it  involves  a  trade-off  between  bias  and  variance [3].  4.  Decision  trees  are  a  popular  supervised  machine  learning  algorithm  used  for  both  classification and regression tasks [4].  5.  To mitigate the limitations of individual decision trees, ensemble methods like random  forests and gradient boosting are often used. These methods combine multiple decision  trees to improve predictive performance and address overfitting [3].  6.  Regression trees are a variant of decision trees that are specifically designed for regression  tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous target variable. While traditional decision  trees are used for classification problems, regression trees partition the feature space based  on the values of input features to predict a continuous numerical outcome [6].    7.  Classification trees  are  a type of decision tree algorithm used for solving classification  problems. Unlike regression trees that predict continuous values, classification trees are  designed to predict categorical or discrete class labels for new data points [8].  8.  Decision trees are interpretable, providing a clear representation of decision-making; they  are  non-parametric,  capable  of  handling  both  categorical  and  numerical  data  without  assumptions or extensive preprocessing [5].  9.  Decision trees can overfit training data, requiring techniques like pruning to avoid it; they  are sensitive to small changes in data, leading to instability, and may struggle to capture  complex relationships, limiting their predictive power [5].
