This topic we covered two supervised machine learning algorithms: KNN and Decision trees.  KNN (K Nearest Neighbour) – A supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. “K” refers to the number of nearest neighbours that are considered when making a prediction for a new data point.  Decision trees – A supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They that make predictions based on a sequence of branching paths organized in a tree-like structure. Their key strength is their interpretability.  Classification trees – Decision trees for classification problems.  Regression trees – Decision tree algorithm used for regression tasks.  Pruning – A technique used in decision tree algorithms to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.
