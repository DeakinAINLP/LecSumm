I confirm that I have successfully learnt the below-mentioned topics.  1.  KNN algorithm and its variants. 2.  Theory of KNN 3.  Best number of neighbours 4.  Decision trees 5.  Regression trees 6.  Classification trees 7.  Decision tree algorithm 8.  Model complexity and pruning 9.  Advantages and disadvantages of decision trees 10.  Advance topics  When starting to learn this topic’s content, I knew the basic concept of KNN algorithm, but I didn’t know it to the depth and had no prior knowledge of the other concepts, so discovering them was really interesting and exciting, as it introduced me to a new facet of machine learning. Additionally, working with Python for the practical implementation of these concepts was a fresh experience for me. After studying the theory, watching the provided videos and lecture, and exploring additional online resources, I was able to comprehend the theories effectively.
