In this topicâ€™s unit learnings we learned about KNN algorithm and its variants. A useful technique of KNN can be to assign weights to the contribution of data point neighbours so the nearer neighbours contribute more to the average than more distant ones. A KNN classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression problems. It works by finding the K nearest points in the training dataset and uses their class to predict the class or value of a new data point. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non- parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. We also learned about the Decision Trees. A decision tree is a map of the possible outcomes of a series of related choices.Decision trees can be used to weigh possible actions against one another based on their costs, benefits and probabilities. there is an other type of DT called regression tree. and onther is called cassification tree. Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is a term introduced by Leo Breiman to refer to decision tree algorithms that can be used for classification or regression predictive modeling problems. Further more I gained the kowledge about logistic regression. logistic regression is also known as logit model. logistic regression is often used for classification and predictive analytics. Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables
