In topic 8, we learned about non-linear models, specifically the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and decision trees (DT). Here's a summary of what we learned:  1. KNN algorithm and its variants: We explored the K-nearest neighbors algorithm, which is a non-linear classification and regression algorithm. We learned about its variants, such as weighted KNN and distance-weighted KNN.  2. Theory of KNN: We delved into the underlying theory of the K-nearest neighbors  algorithm. We understood how it classifies or predicts based on the nearest neighbors in the feature space.  3. Best number of neighbors (K): We discussed the importance of selecting the optimal number of neighbors (K) in the K-nearest neighbors algorithm. We learned about techniques like cross-validation to determine the best value of K for a given dataset.  4. Decision trees: We were introduced to decision trees, which are non-linear models that partition the feature space into regions and make predictions based on these partitions. We learned about their structure and how they can be used for both classification and regression problems.  5. Regression trees: We studied decision trees specifically used for regression tasks. We learned how regression trees split the feature space and assign a value to each region, enabling them to make continuous predictions.  6. Classification trees: We understood decision trees in the context of classification  problems. We learned how decision trees split the feature space based on different criteria to classify instances into different classes.  7. Decision tree algorithms: We discussed various algorithms used for constructing  decision trees, such as ID3, C4.5, and CART. We learned about their differences and advantages.  8. Model complexity and pruning: We explored techniques for managing the complexity of decision tree models. We learned about pruning, which helps prevent overfitting by removing unnecessary branches and nodes from the tree.  9. 10. Decision trees advantages and disadvantages: We analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of decision trees as a modeling technique. We discussed their interpretability, ability to handle non-linear relationships, and susceptibility to overfitting.  11. Advanced topics: We covered advanced topics related to KNN and decision trees, such as ensemble methods (e.g., random forests) and boosting algorithms (e.g., AdaBoost).  12. Implementation in Python: We learned how to implement K-nearest neighbors and decision trees in Python, gaining hands-on experience in applying these models to real-world datasets.  Reflection:  During topic 8, we focused on non-linear models, specifically the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and decision trees (DT). These models provide powerful tools for solving classification and regression problems.  We gained a solid understanding of the theoretical foundations behind KNN and decision trees, including their algorithms, variants, and the best practices for selecting parameters like the number of neighbors (K).  Decision trees, in particular, proved to be versatile models that can handle both classification and regression tasks. We explored their structure, algorithms for constructing them, and techniques for managing model complexity through pruning.  We also examined the advantages and disadvantages of these models, considering factors such as interpretability, handling of non-linear relationships, and the risk of overfitting.  By implementing KNN and decision trees in Python, we were able to apply our knowledge to real-world datasets, gaining hands-on experience in using these models for predictive tasks.  Overall, topic 8 provided us with a comprehensive understanding of non-linear modeling techniques and equipped us with practical skills to utilize KNN and decision trees effectively in various machine learning scenarios.
