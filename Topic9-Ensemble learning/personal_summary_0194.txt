KNN algorithm and its variants:  A straightforward and well-liked classification algorithm in machine learning is K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN). It is a non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm, which means it uses the entire dataset to generate predictions without making any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.  In order to apply the label of the majority class among the K nearest neighbours to a new, unlabelled data point in the training dataset, the KNN algorithm first finds the K nearest data points (i.e., the nearest neighbours) to the new data point.  The KNN algorithm has been proposed in a number of different variations over time. Popular variations include:    Weighted KNN: In this variant, the K nearest neighbours are weighted by their  distance to the new data point before making predictions. The closer neighbours have a higher weight than the farther neighbours, which can improve the accuracy of the algorithm.    KNN with distance-based outlier detection: This variant uses the KNN algorithm to  detect outliers in the dataset. It assigns a score to each data point based on the average distance to its K nearest neighbours, and data points with high scores are considered as outliers.    Preceding the application of the KNN algorithm, this variant chooses a subset of the  dataset's most important features. For high-dimensional datasets in particular, this can increase the algorithm's accuracy and speed.    Kernel KNN: In this variation, the distance metric used by the KNN algorithm is  given a kernel function, which can enhance the algorithm's performance on datasets that cannot be separated linearly.  Generally speaking, the KNN algorithm and its variations are frequently used in classification, regression, and outlier detection tasks and can be useful in a variety of real- world applications. But they might not work well in high-dimensional spaces and can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.  Theory of KNN:  The K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm is a classification algorithm in machine learning that works by finding the K closest data points (i.e., the K nearest neighbours) to a new, unlabelled data point in the training dataset, and assigning the label of the majority class among the K nearest neighbours to the new data point.  The following steps can be used to summarise the KNN algorithm:  1.  Calculate the Euclidean distance between a new, unlabelled data point x and all N samples in a labelled dataset with N samples and their corresponding class labels.  2.  Choose the K samples that are closest to x and note their class labels.  3.  Assign the new data point x the class label that appears most frequently among the K  closest neighbours.  K's value is a hyperparameter in the KNN algorithm that the user must specify. A low value of K can result in overfitting, which where the algorithm may pick up on the data's noise, while a high value of K can result in underfitting, where the an algorithm may be unable to recognise the data's underlying structure. The cross-validation or different model selection strategies can be used to calculate the value of K.  The KNN algorithm is an example of instance-based learning, which means that it uses the entire dataset to generate predictions without making any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. Because it is non-parametric, no fixed parameters need to be estimated from the data in order for it to work. The algorithm, which can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, instead makes predictions based on the data's local structure.  The KNN algorithm has some drawbacks, including the potential for high computational costs, particularly for large datasets. The algorithm might also struggle in high-dimensional spaces, where the meaning of distance is diminished. Weighted KNN, KNN with distance- based outlier detection, KNN with feature selection, and kernel KNN are some of the variations of the KNN algorithm that have been proposed over the years to address some of these limitations.  Best number of neighbours (K):  The K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm for machine learning can perform significantly better or worse depending on how many neighbours (K) are selected. The ideal value of K typically depends on the particular dataset and the issue at hand.  K may be too small, which could make the algorithm sensitive to data noise and lead to overfitting. The algorithm might oversimplify the decision boundary if K is too large, which would lead to underfitting. In order to achieve good performance, K should be carefully chosen.  In the KNN algorithm, the optimal value of K can be chosen using a variety of techniques, such as:    Grid search: This entails testing various values of K to see how well the KNN  algorithm performs, then choosing the value of K that produces the best performance based on some evaluation metric, such as accuracy or F1 score. Though expensive in terms of computation, this method works well for small datasets.    Cross-validation: In this process, the dataset is divided into training and validation  sets, and the effectiveness of the KNN algorithm is assessed using the validation set with various values of K. Grid search is computationally more expensive than this method, which may be more useful for bigger datasets.    Domain knowledge: The decision regarding K may also be influenced by the domain knowledge or prior information regarding the issue. For instance, a higher value of K might be more appropriate if the issue is finding rare events.  In general, the optimal K value for the KNN algorithm depends on the particular dataset and problem at hand rather than having a set rule. It is common practise to test a variety of K values and choose the one that performs best on a validation set or with cross-validation.  Decision trees:  Decision Trees are a popular and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The algorithm builds a tree-like model of decisions based on the features in the input data, where each node in the tree represents a feature and each branch represents a possible value or range of values for that feature.  The basic idea behind a decision tree is to recursively split the data based on the features to create homogeneous subgroups of the data that have similar class labels or regression outputs. The decision tree algorithm uses a criterion, such as entropy or Gini impurity, to select the feature that best splits the data at each node.  The process of building a decision tree can be summarized as follows:    Select the best feature to split the data based on the criterion.   Create a branch for each possible value or range of values for the selected feature.   Recursively apply steps 1 and 2 to each subset of data until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth, having a minimum number of samples at a leaf node, or having a minimum reduction in impurity.  Once the decision tree is built, it can be used to make predictions by traversing the tree from the root node to a leaf node based on the values of the input features, and assigning the corresponding class label or regression output.  Decision trees have several advantages, including:    Easy to understand and interpret.   Can handle both categorical and numerical data.   Can handle missing values and outliers.   Can capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.  However, decision trees can also have some limitations, including:    Can overfit the training data if the tree is too deep or not pruned properly.   Can be sensitive to small variations in the data.   May not generalize well to unseen data.  Classification tree:  Classification trees are a type of decision tree algorithm used for classification tasks in machine learning. The algorithm builds a tree-like model of decisions based on the features in the input data, where each node in the tree represents a feature and each branch represents a possible value or range of values for that feature.  The basic idea behind a classification tree is to recursively split the data based on the features to create homogeneous subgroups of the data that have similar class labels. The decision tree algorithm uses a criterion, such as entropy or Gini impurity, to select the feature that best splits the data at each node.  Impact of distance metrics on KNN performance:  The performance of the KNN algorithm in machine learning can be significantly impacted by the choice of distance metric. When determining the closest neighbours for a given data point, the distance metric is used to gauge how similar or dissimilar two data points are to one another.  Some common distance metrics used in KNN are:    Euclidean distance: This is the most commonly used distance metric in KNN. It is  calculated as the square root of the sum of squared differences between the corresponding features of two data points.    Manhattan distance: Also known as city block distance, this metric is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between the corresponding features of two data points.    Cosine similarity: This metric is used for text classification or clustering tasks. It  measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors representing two data points.    Hamming distance: This metric is used for categorical or binary data. It measures the number of positions at which the corresponding features of two data points differ.  The selection of a distance metric can generally have the following effects on KNN performance:    Accuracy: The KNN algorithm's accuracy can be impacted by the distance metric that is selected. Depending on the problem and the data, different distance metrics may perform better or worse.    Speed: The KNN algorithm's speed can also be impacted by the distance metric you choose. When applied to large datasets, some distance metrics, like Euclidean distance, can be computationally expensive and slow down the algorithm.    Robustness: The KNN algorithm's resistance to noise and outliers in the data can be influenced by the distance metric that is selected. Some distance measures, like the distance from Manhattan, are more resistant to outliers than others.
