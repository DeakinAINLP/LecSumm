1.  The  primary  focus  of  this  topic's  study  was  on  two  signiﬁcant  machine  learning methodologies:  K-Nearest  Neighbors  (KNN)  and  Decision  Trees.  The  subjects  discussed included the underlying principles of KNN, the opEmal selecEon of neighbors (K), diﬀerent types of decision trees (regression and classiﬁcaEon trees), decision tree algorithms, model intricacy and pruning, and the pros and cons of decision trees.  2.

The  insights  gained  from  this  topic's  content  have  deepened  our  understanding  of  two crucial machine learning algorithms, KNN and Decision Trees. We explored the theoreEcal and pracEcal aspects of KNN, including how to select the best K value. We also delved into decision trees,  including  regression  and  classiﬁcaEon  trees,  various  algorithms,  model  complexity, pruning techniques, and their pros and cons. The pracEcal implementaEon of both algorithms in Python was also discussed. This knowledge will be beneﬁcial in eﬀecEvely applying these algorithms to various machine learning tasks.
