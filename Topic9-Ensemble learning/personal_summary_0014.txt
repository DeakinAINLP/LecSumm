The topics module covered KNN and DT (decision tree) models, which can both be used for regression and classification problems. For regression problems the KNN model uses the weighted mean values of the K nearest training examples to estimate values for a datapoint, for classification it uses the mode of the class labels of the K nearest training examples. Finding optimal values for K can be quite difficult, so cross-validation can be used to find the best performing values of K for a dataset.  Regression Trees function by splitting feature space into distinct and non-overlapping regions, these regions are found by minimising the training error. Splitting is performed using heuristics, i.e. if a feature has a value greater or less than some threshold. Predictions are made using the mean or mode of regions where the test features are split to.  Classification Trees function in a similar way, except they use the majority class in each region to predict results. Gini index and Entropy are metrics that are used to find regions in a classification tree.
