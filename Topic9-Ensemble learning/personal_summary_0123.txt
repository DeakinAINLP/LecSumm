 The topics that were covered during topic 8 were concepts focusing on K nearest neighbor(KNN) algorithm, Decision tree. Then, implementation of KNN and decision trees in python.  I referred to the unit site contents for learning the topics that were covered in topic 8 along with the external video links and articles provided.  The learning journey started with the basic understanding of KNN algorithm and its variants, theory of KNN which involved continuous valued target function and discrete class label. I gained an idea on the concept of how to pick the best number of neighbours(K). Then, I gathered knowledge about Decision trees, regression trees, classification trees, Gini and. Then, learnt about decision tree algorithms namely Iterative Dichotomiser 3(ID3),C4.5(Successor of ID3) and CART(Classification and Regression Tree) were discussed in which ID3 were covered in a detail manner. I gained an understanding of pruning which is a technique which reduces the size of decision trees by removing the tree sections that provide little power to classify the instances, the pruning ways: Pre-pruning and Post-pruning, advantages, and disadvantages of decision trees, impact of distance metrics on KNN performance. Finally, I acquired knowledge on implementation of KNN in python , decision trees in python.
