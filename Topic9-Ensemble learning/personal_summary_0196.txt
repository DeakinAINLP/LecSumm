This module covers nonlinear models continuing on from last topics SVM and expanding to K-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithms. KNN works by measuring the distance between a point and the K nearest points classifying them based on distance (using any distance measure such as Euclidean or Manhattan distances for example)  Reï¬‚ection This topics tasks were not particularly complicated but helped me to understand the topics to a greater degree. The quiz felt similar to the previous topics quiz as it covered many similar topics.
