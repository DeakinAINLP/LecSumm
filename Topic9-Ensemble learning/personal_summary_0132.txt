This topic, I studied K nearest neighbor algorithms and decision trees. I understood the KNN concept, theory, algorithms, and how to find the best number of neighbors. I understood the concepts of decision trees, regression trees, classification trees, and the advantages/disadvantages of decision trees. I understood how to calculate the Gini index and impurity, and entropy. I saw the Tree depth concept, ID3 algorithm, and ways to reduce model complexity by using pruning methods. I understood the impact of distance metrics on KNN performance and feature importance while using decision trees.
