 In this topic we cover the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non- parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.  A Decision Tree has one kind of classifier (supervised learning) and 2 kinds of nodes. Each leaf node has a class label, determined by majority vote of training examples reaching that Leaf and Each internal node is a question on features. It branches out according to the answers.
