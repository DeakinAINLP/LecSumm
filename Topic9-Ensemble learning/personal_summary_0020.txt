Nonlinear models (KNN and DT)  LEARNING REPORT  Topic 8 introduces two important machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees. The topics covered include KNN algorithm and its variants, the theory of KNN, finding the best number of neighbors (K), decision trees, regression trees, classification trees, decision tree algorithms, model complexity and pruning, advantages and disadvantages of decision trees,  and advanced topics in KNN and decision trees.  KNN algorithm is a simple and intuitive algorithm used for classification and regression problems. It works by finding the K nearest data points to a new observation, and then predicting the class or value of the new observation based on the classes or values of its K nearest neighbors. The variants of KNN include weighted KNN, distance-weighted KNN, and kernel-weighted KNN. The theory of KNN involves understanding the distance metrics used to calculate the distance between the new observation and its neighbors, as well as the choice of K. Choosing the right value of K is crucial as it can affect the performance of the algorithm. One common approach to find the best K is through cross-validation. Decision trees are another popular machine learning algorithm used for both regression and classification tasks. Decision trees work by recursively splitting the data based on the most informative feature, creating a tree-like structure that can be used to make predictions. The different types of decision trees include regression trees, which are used for predicting continuous values, and classification trees, which are used for predicting discrete values. The decision tree algorithms include ID3, C4.5, and CART. These algorithms differ in the way they choose the splitting criterion and handle missing data. Model complexity and pruning are important concepts in decision trees, as overfitting can occur when the tree becomes too complex. The advantages of decision trees include their interpretability and ease of use, while their disadvantages include their tendency to overfit, sensitivity to small changes in the data, and difficulty in handling continuous variables. In the advanced topics covered, we learned about how to implement KNN and decision trees in Python. This involved using the scikit-learn library, which provides efficient and easy-to-use tools for machine learning. Topic 8 covered important concepts and techniques in machine learning. By understanding the theory and practical implementation of KNN and decision trees, you can use these algorithms to solve a wide range of real-world problems.
