 ➢  KNN : ANN stands for k-nearest neighbors and is a type of machine learning algorithm  used for classification or regression tasks. It finds the k training samples (neighborhoods) that are closest to a given test sample in the feature space, and uses their labels (in classification) or values (in regression) to derive the test sample's label or value. It works by predicting. The distance metric used to determine nearest neighbors is usually Euclidean distance, but other distance metrics such as Manhattan distance or Minkowski distance can also be used. ANN is a nonparametric algorithm. That is, it makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.  ➢  Decision tree (DT):  Decision tree (DT) is a nonparametric supervised learning method  used for classification and regression. This is a tree-like model where each interior node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf he node represents a class label or continuous value. The goal of decision trees is to build a model that predicts the value of a target variable based on multiple input variables. The process of building a decision tree involves choosing the best split at each node to maximize information gain or minimize data pollution. Once the tree is built, it can be used to make predictions on new data by traversing the tree based on new data characteristics until it reaches a leaf node.  ➢  Regression Trees : A regression tree is a type of decision tree used to predict continuous numeric output variables. They work by recursively dividing the input space into regions corresponding to different output values. At each node in the tree, a splitting criterion is used to select the input variables and thresholds that best split the data into two subsets that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual output values. The tree grows until stopping criteria such as maximum depth or minimum observations per leaf node are met. Once the tree is built, new observations can be classified by walking the tree from the root node to the leaf nodes and using the corresponding predicted output values as regression estimates.  ➢  Classification Trees: A classification tree is a type of decision tree used to predict the class of a given instance based on its characteristics. Each inner node of the tree represents one feature-based decision, and each leaf node represents a predictor class. Decisions at each internal node are made based on the function that provides the maximum information gain or reduction in Gini pollution. Offers.
