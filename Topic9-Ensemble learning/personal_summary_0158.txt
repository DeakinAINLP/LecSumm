For the topic eight coursework, the main takeaway was the K nearest neighbor algorithm together with decision trees. To start off, I got to understand the application of KNN in supervised machine learning tasks and how the algorithm works by assigning weights to distances between data points making higher distance neighbours of the node have lower weignts.  Other than this, I learnt how the choice of k value used in a classification or regression problem greatly affects
