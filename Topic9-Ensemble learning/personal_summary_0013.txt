In Topic Eight we explored the concepts of KNN and the Decision Tree Algorithm. To start we dove into KNN and its fundamental concept, finishing with a method to find the best value for K. We then went to Decision Trees, covering both Regression and Classification trees, and looked at the advantages and disadvantages of this method. Finally, we learnt how to apply both KNN and Decision Tress utilising Python.
