Topic 8 Learning Summary Report  Name: Viola Birech  Assignment: Task 8.1P  Institution: Deakin University  Date: 19/05/2023  1         Summary Report  Topic 8 Learning Summary  In topic 8 of our machine learning class, we covered a range of topics related to the K Nearest  Neighbour algorithm (KNN) and the Decision tree (DT). KNN is a useful technique can be to assign  weights to the contribution of data point neighbours, so the nearer neighbours contribute more to the  average than more distant ones, useful for both classification and regression. A decision tree,  however, is a map of the possible outcomes of a series of related choices. Decision trees can be used  to weigh possible actions against one another based on their costs, benefits and probabilities. A  decision tree typically starts with a single root node, which branches into possible outcomes. In the  video you will see an example of how a decision tree can be used to predict commute time. We also  explored the regression and classification trees.  Reflection  During topic 8 of my machine learning class, I studied various topics related to KNN. I  learned about how the K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm as one of the most interesting and  powerful machine learning methods. Overall, I found the topic 8 topics very informative and relevant  to the field of machine learning. I look forward to applying these techniques in practical projects and  experiments.  Summary of Reading List  The eighth section of the machine learning course incorporated a range of resources for  utilization which were all like the previous topicsâ€™ resources. I found these resources very helpful to  my understanding of the content studied. These readings consist of textbooks such as, Hands-On  Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow and Python Machine Learning  Other additional resources are the various code libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and  scikit-learn which can be heavily utilized to learn and practicalize the lessons learnt. Research papers  and articles from journals are also crucial resources to enhance investigation on current research areas  in the field of machine learning. Online platforms like Kaggle and Data Camp are also critical in  utilization as supplementary materials for practice exercises and tutorials.  2    Quiz Score  3
