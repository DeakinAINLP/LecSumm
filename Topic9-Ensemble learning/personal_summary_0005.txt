KNN algorithm is used for both regression and classification tasks. It determines the label of a test  point  based  on  the  majority  class  of  its  K-nearest  neighbors.  The  theory  of  K-nearest neighbors (KNN) involves calculating the Euclidean distance between data points and making decisions  based  on  the  average  or  mean  in  continuous  cases  or  the  mode  of  class  labels  in discrete cases. There is also another method called Shepard's method which allows all training points to  influence  a particular instance. This distance-weighted nearest  neighbor algorithm assigns weights to neighbors based on their distance from the test point, often using the inverse square of the distances as weights,  The  selection  of  the  number  of  neighbors  (K)  in  K-nearest  neighbors  (KNN)  impacts  the decision boundary shape. Smaller K values focus on close neighbors with low bias and high variance,  while  larger  K  values  provide  smoother  boundaries  with  reduced  variance  but increased bias. Cross-validation helps evaluate different K values, and there is no specific rule for choosing K. A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm which maps related choices and their potential outcomes, considering costs, benefits, and probabilities. It starts with a root node and branches to different possibilities, as demonstrated in the video for predicting commute time. A variant of decision tree, regression tree partition the feature space into regions and fit simple models, like the mean, in each region to minimize training error. Predictions are made based on the mean (or mode) of training instances in the corresponding region. Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are decision tree algorithms used for classification or regression problems. In classification trees, test instances are assigned to the majority class in  their  respective  regions.  Classification  error  rate,  Gini  index,  and  entropy  are  commonly used  criteria  for  making  binary  splits  in  classification  trees.  These  measures  evaluate  the certainty and inequality of class distribution within regions. Gini index represents node purity, while entropy provides a smoother alternative. CART is sensitive to inequalities, and the choice of criteria depends on the desired measure of purity. There are various decision tree algorithms, including ID3, C4.5, and CART. ID3 and C4.5 use entropy for feature selection, while CART uses Gini impurity. The ID3 algorithm, developed by Ross Quinlan, calculates the entropy of features and recursively builds a decision tree based on the minimum entropy. The depth of the tree affects the trade-off between variance and bias, and finding the right depth can be done through techniques like cross-validation. Tuning the depth is crucial for optimal decision tree performance. Complexity  of  a  decision  tree  model  can  be  reduced  by  Pruning  to  prevent  overfitting.  It involves removing sections of the tree that contribute little to classification accuracy. Decision trees  have  advantages  such  as  being  easy  to  understand,  capable  of  modeling  nonlinear functions, and able to handle categorical variables, but they also have disadvantages including sensitivity to small data changes, susceptibility to overfitting, reliance on axis-aligned splits, and lower accuracy compared to other methods. The choice of distance metric in KNN significantly affects its performance, with options like Euclidean  distance,  Manhattan  distance,  and  cosine  similarity  having  varying  impacts depending  on  the  problem  and  data  type.  Additionally,  Decision  Trees  determine  feature importance by recursively segmenting data based on informative features, using criteria such as  information  gain  or  the  Gini  index,  allowing for  identification  of  significant  features  for classification and improved model performance.
