Summary In  topic  8  we  covered  2  important  algorithms  KNN  and  decision  tree  along  with  their  python implementation. In addition, we also learnt regression and classification trees separately along with model complexity and an advanced topic called impact of distance in KNN and feature importance of using decision trees.  Reading List We kick start from 8.1 to 8.4 with discussion regarding KNN algorithm along with-it various variants and  the  basic  theory  behind  them  and  along  with  that  we  then  learned  how  to  find  best  suitable number of neighbors which is the most optimal parameter for KNN.  Then in 8.5 we are introduced to decision trees and then in 8.6 and 8.7 we cover in detail regression trees  and  classification  trees.  And  then  in  8.8  we  dive  into  how  DT  algorithm  actually  works  and furthermore in 8.9 and 8.10 we discussed model complexity along with merits and demerits of DT.  8.11 covers some additional topics like impact of distance in KNN and feature importance for DT and then we finished with 8.12 and 8.13 which covers python implementation of both algorithms covered this topic.
