SIT720 Machine Learning  Topic 8 Evidence of Learning  1.  Summarise the main points that is covered in this topic.  A common non-parametric supervised machine learning approach used for both classification and regression problems are the k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm. It uses the idea of similarity between data points and is a straightforward, understandable algorithm. In KNN, a new data point's output value is decided by most of its k nearest neighbours in the feature space (for classification) or by the average of those neighbours (for regression). (IBM, n.d.)  Unlike other algorithms like decision trees or neural networks, the KNN method does not explicitly train or develop models. When making predictions, it makes use of the training data that has been saved and computes distances. It is therefore regarded as a sluggish learning algorithm. A well-liked supervised machine learning technique for classification and regression applications is decision trees. They are adaptable, comprehensible, and capable of handling both categorical and numerical data. By recursively dividing the input space into subsets based on the values of various attributes, a decision tree constructs a model. The final model is represented as a tree-like structure, with each partition standing in for a choice or a rule. (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019)  Regression trees are a subset of decision trees created explicitly for regression problems, often known as decision trees for regression. Regression trees predict continuous numeric values rather than discrete class labels, which is how they differ from classic decision trees, which are used for classification issues. Regression trees are suitable when the targeted variable is continuous and there is a nonlinear connection between the characteristics and the target variable. (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019b)  Classification trees, sometimes referred to as decision trees for classification, are a particular kind of decision tree algorithm created to address classification-related issues. They are frequently used in situations where the target variable is discrete or categorical in machine learning and data mining. A classification tree's major objective is to divide the feature space according to the values of the input features, producing decision rules or branches that correctly classify the target variable.
