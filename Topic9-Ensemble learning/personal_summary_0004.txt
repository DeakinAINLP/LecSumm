This module covered non-Linear models with a focus on KNN and Decision Trees. KNN is a model that partitions that data on a plane using the Voronoi diagram to find the expected margins (borders or regions) based on the distance between specific data subsets. Weights can be used to manipulate the importance of certain features between subsets. Deloni triangulation can be used alongside Voronoi partitioning  to  define  the  paths  between  data  subsets.  Shepherds  method  can  be  used  in  some circumstances as an alternative to KNN and may actually perform better. Whereas Decision Trees on the  other  hand  divide  the  data  into  a  binary  decision  tree,  and  can  be  further  adjusted  by  adding weights to the algorithm to cause it to stop when certain metrics are met at leaf nodes to over fitting or a too granular model.
