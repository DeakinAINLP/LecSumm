The main points that were covered this topic are around decision trees and K nearest neighborsâ€™ algorithms. The theory behind how these algorithms work was covered, and some of their individual variants. There was also some learning about model complexity for decision trees, and how to optimize that. In addition, we also learnt about the advantages and disadvantages of decision trees. We also looked through and learnt about the implementation of both algorithms.
