K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): supervised machine learning algorithm for classifications and regression. When making a prediction of a new data point, the number of nearest data points in the same cluster or K would decide which the cluster of that data point.  How to find K?: using Cross validation to tune hyperparameters  Decision Tress: supervised machine learning used for regression and classification. The model uses tree map (root, leaf) to evaluate each decision to find the suitable collection of decision.  Impurity: -  Gini: probability of misclassification of an observation  -  Entropy: measure the uncertainty or disorder of an observation.  Pruning:  technique to prevent overfitting by reducing the size of tree: -  Pre-pruning: decide to stop adding nodes when building the tree -  Post-pruning: build the whole decision tree, then pruning by replacing subtrees.
