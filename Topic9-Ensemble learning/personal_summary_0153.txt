In this topic, I covered several topics related to KNN, Decision Tree models and etc. I started with the concept of understanding basics. KNN is a versatile algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In classification, the class label  is  determined  by  majority  voting  among  the  K  nearest  neighbors.  In regression, the predicted value is calculated as the average or weighted average of the K nearest neighbors' target values. The choice of K is an important parameter in KNN. A smaller value of K may lead to overfitting and higher variance, while a larger value of K may lead to underfitting and higher bias.  Decision trees are constructed by recursively partitioning the feature space based on  the  values  of  different  features.  The  nodes  in  a  decision  tree  represent conditions on the features, while the edges represent the possible outcomes. In classification,  the  leaf  nodes  of  the  tree  represent  the  class  labels,  while  in regression,  they  represent  the  predicted  values.  Decision  trees  offer  advantages such as interpretability, handling both numerical and categorical data, and handling missing values. However, they can be prone to overfitting and may not perform well  with  complex  datasets.  Pruning  techniques  can  be  applied  to  control  the complexity of the tree and improve its generalization capability. Python provides various  libraries  like  scikit-learn  and  matplotlib  for  implementing  and  visualizing decision  trees.  These  libraries  offer  advanced  visualization  techniques  such  as plotting  the  tree  structure  and  feature  importance  to  gain  insights  into  the decision-making process of the model.
