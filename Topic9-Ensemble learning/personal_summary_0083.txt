 KNN is an algorithm that determines the value or classification of any given data  point based on the values of itâ€™s nearest neighbours. The value of K is how many neighbours are used for the calculation. KNN can be used for both regression and classification problems.  Decision trees are another model that can be used for both regression and  classification problems. It works by splitting the data based on a feature that results in the best information gain. The model then uses the decisions made previously to make the next decision. This process continues recursively until the subsets are as pure as possible or a stopping criterion is met.
