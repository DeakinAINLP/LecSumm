 Decision trees and the KNN algorithm were this topic's two key topics. The KNN algorithm is a non- parametric, slow learning method that may be used to solve both classification and regression issues. It initially finds the k closest data points in the training set to the supplied query point to predict the label or value of the query point based on the labels or values of the nearby neighbors. We also discussed several KNN algorithm modifications and the process for figuring out the best value for k. Decision trees are another type of machine learning technique that may be used for both classification and regression applications. Recursively dividing the feature space into areas that correspond to various expected labels or values is how they operate. We Discussed about the many kinds of decision trees, the techniques used to create them, and the significance of model complexity and pruning. Finally, we reviewed advanced subjects pertaining to both KNN and decision trees, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of decision trees. We also discussed utilising the scikit-learn module to create KNN and decision tree algorithms in Python.
