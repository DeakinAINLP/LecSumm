The  K-Nearest  Neighbors  (KNN)  algorithm  is  a  non-parametric  supervised  learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. KNN makes predictions based on the similarity between a new instance and its neighboring instances in the feature  space.  The  algorithm  assigns  the  majority  class  label  (for  classification)  or calculates the average (for regression) of the K nearest neighbors.  Variants  of  KNN  include  weighted  KNN,  where  the  contributions  of  neighbors  are weighted based on their proximity, and distance-weighted KNN, where the weights are inversely proportional to the distances between instances.  Theory of KNN:  The  theory  of  KNN  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  instances  with  similar  feature values  tend  to  have  similar  labels.  The  algorithm  calculates  the  distance  between instances  using  metrics  like  Euclidean  distance  or  Manhattan  distance.  It  then identifies  the  K  nearest  neighbors based  on the  distances  and  assigns the majority class label or computes the average value of the neighbors to make predictions.  Best number of neighbors (K):  The choice of the number of neighbors (K) in KNN is critical and affects the model's performance. A small K value may lead to overfitting, where the model is sensitive to noise.  On  the  other  hand,  a  large  K  value  may  introduce  bias  and  oversmooth  the decision  boundaries.  The  optimal  K  value  depends  on  the  dataset  and  can  be determined through techniques like cross-validation.  Decision trees:  Decision trees are a popular supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They represent decisions and their possible consequences as a  tree-like  structure.  Each  internal node  represents  a  feature  or attribute, and  each leaf  node  represents  a  class  label  (for  classification)  or  a  predicted  value  (for regression).  Regression trees:  Regression trees are decision trees used for regression tasks. They recursively split the data based on feature thresholds to minimize the variance of the predicted values within  each  leaf  node.  Regression  trees  are  useful  for  capturing  non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.  Classification trees:  Classification trees are decision trees used for classification tasks. They split the data based  on  feature  thresholds  to  maximize  the  information  gain  or  Gini  index,  which measures the impurity of the class labels within each leaf node. Classification trees are effective in identifying decision boundaries and classifying instances into different classes.  Decision tree algorithms:  Several  algorithms  are  used  to  construct  decision  trees,  including  ID3  (Iterative Dichotomiser  3),  C4.5,  CART  (Classification  and  Regression  Trees),  and  Random Forests.  These  algorithms  employ  different  strategies  for  feature  selection,  tree construction, and pruning.  Model complexity and pruning:  Decision  trees  can  become  overly  complex,  leading  to  overfitting  and  reduced generalization  performance.  Model  complexity  can  be  controlled  through  pruning techniques  such  as  cost-complexity  pruning  (also  known  as  weakest  link  pruning). Pruning  removes  nodes  or  branches  from  the  tree  to  simplify  the  model  while maintaining its predictive accuracy.  Decision trees advantages and disadvantages:  Advantages  of  decision  trees  include  their  interpretability,  ability  to  handle  both categorical  and  numerical  features,  and  robustness  against  outliers.  However, decision trees can be sensitive to small variations in the data and may easily overfit noisy or complex datasets.   Advanced topics:  Advanced  topics  in  decision  trees  include  ensemble  methods  such  as  Random Forests  and  Gradient  Boosting,  which  combine  multiple  decision  trees  to  improve prediction  accuracy.  Other  topics  include  handling  missing  values,  handling imbalanced datasets, and handling categorical variables in decision tree algorithms.  8.12 KNN in Python:  Python  provides  various  libraries  like  scikit-learn  and  KNeighborsClassifier  for implementing KNN. These libraries allow users to specify the number of neighbors, distance  metrics,  and  other parameters.
