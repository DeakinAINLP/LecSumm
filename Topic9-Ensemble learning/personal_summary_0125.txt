In topic 8, the main topic that we looked at and learned about were K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees (DT). They are non-linear models for classification and regression problems in the case of KNN and for classification problems for DT. The idea of KNNs is similar to that of NNs and so understanding them and implementing them wasnâ€™t all too difficult. We explored the technique of how to use them, and under what circumstances you want to use them for. A DT is a map of the possible outcomes of a series of related choices. We looked at several algorithms used for DTs such as ID3, C4.5, and CART. The advantages and disadvantages of DTs were also looked at, and we learned what to be careful of when we implement them into our code.
