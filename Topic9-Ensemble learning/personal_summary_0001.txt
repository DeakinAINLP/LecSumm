The KNN algorithm is used for classification and regression, and the Decision tree algorithm, which is used for classification and regression. While KNN works by finding the k-nearest data points to the input data point, DT recursively splits the data into smaller subsets based on the most informative features and creates a tree-like structure to make predictions or classifications. Advantages and disadvantages of the Decision tree algorithm, including its interpretability, ability to handle both categorical and numerical data, and its susceptibility to overfitting and instability. Finally, we examined the different types of Decision trees, including Regression tree for regression problems and Classification tree for classification problems. Both KNN and DT are widely used in various domains of machine learning and data science, making them essential tools for data scientists and researchers alike.
