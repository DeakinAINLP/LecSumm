The main points covered this topic were focused on two important machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees. Topics included the theory behind KNN, choosing the best number of neighbors (K), various decision tree types (regression and classiÔ¨ÅcaDon trees), decision tree algorithms, model complexity and pruning, and the advantages and disadvantages of decision trees.
