This topic covered the KNN algorithm and its variants, as well as decision trees for regression and classification problems. We also learned about model complexity, pruning, and the advantages and disadvantages of decision trees. Finally, we applied the KNN and decision tree algorithms in Python using the scikit-learn library and evaluated their performance on the digits dataset.
