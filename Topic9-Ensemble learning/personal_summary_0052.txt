During topic eight of the course, we focused on supervised learning, which mainly on K Neighearst Neighbor(KNN) and Decision Tree. The lecture covered the importance of  understanding  Euclidean  distance,  along  with  finding  the  best  numbers  of neighbors. It also delved into the Decision tree classifier and difference between KNN and tree classifier approach and the advantages of KNN. We also learned about the sci-kit processes in Python, which can be used to implement KNN and Decision Tree on train data and evaluation on test data and use of different kernels to get the get performance. Overall, the lecture provided a deep understanding of KNN and Decision tree.
