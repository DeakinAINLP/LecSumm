 KNN:  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Intuitive algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks in machine learning. It operates based on the idea that similar instances are likely to have similar outputs and selects the K nearest neighbors (data points) based on the calculated distances.    Its main hyperparameter is n_estimators which indicates the number of nearest neighbors to consider  Decision tree: It models decisions or predictions based on a series of sequential, hierarchical decisions or rules.    Nodes: A node in a decision tree represents a specific attribute or feature.   Root: Starting node  Leaf: Ending nodes   Pruning: Pruning techniques are applied to simplify and reduce the size of the decision tree,  enhancing its ability to generalize to new data.  Advantages and disadvantages of decision trees:    Very easy to understand, as they represent rules.   Capable of modelling nonlinear functions.   Can handle categorical variables   Sensitive to small changes in the data.   May overfit easily.
