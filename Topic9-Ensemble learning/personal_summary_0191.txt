For classification and regression applications, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) technique is a straightforward and efficient supervised machine learning approach. It is a non-parametric approach that does not rely on any presumptions regarding the distribution of the underlying data. Instead, it bases predictions on the closeness of data points in the feature space. KNN can be utilized for regression tasks when the goal function is continuous. Based on a fresh input sample's proximity to the training samples, the objective is to predict a continuous value for that sample. The KNN technique is used for classification tasks when a desired function consists of discrete class labels. The objective is to assign a class label to a new input sample based on its proximity to the training samples.  The (KNN) algorithm's performance may be affected by the decision made on the number of neighbors (K). Numerous variables should be tested and evaluated in order to establish the ideal number of neighbors.  Both classification and regression problems can be accomplished using the flexible and well-  liked supervised machine learning approach known as decision trees. These are logical models that divide the data into subsets recursively based on the values of the input features and then generate predictions from those subsets. These divisions produce a tree-like hierarchical structure where each internal node denotes a judgement based on a feature and each leaf node denotes a predicted result.  A particular kind of decision tree called a regression tree is used for regression tasks when  the objective is to predict a continuous target variable. Regression trees, in contrast to classification trees, estimate the numerical value of the target variable based on the characteristics of the input data.  Another type of decision tree called a classification tree is used to solve classification problems, where the objective is to categorize input samples according to their features. A predicted class label is represented by each leaf in a classification tree, which divides the feature space into regions or leaves. Classification trees' building and prediction phases resemble those of decision trees. The methods used by classification trees to choose the splitting criteria and assess the quality of the splits, however, vary. Gini impurity and entropy are two often used metrics for this. Gini impurity is a measurement of the likelihood that a randomly selected element in a specific region or leaf would be incorrectly labelled if it were randomly labelled in accordance with the class distribution in that region. It measures the region's impurity or disorder. Another indicator of impurity or disorder in a specific area or leaf is entropy. It quantifies the typical quantity of data needed to accurately categorize a piece from that location.  The ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm, which is used to create classification trees, is a  well-known decision tree algorithm. The tree is built using a top-down, greedy strategy by the ID3 algorithm. Starting with the complete training dataset, it divides the data into information- gain categories at each stage by choosing the best feature.  Model complexity in the context of decision trees refers to the size, depth, and quantity of decision rules that the tree contains. A more complicated decision tree may recognize subtle patterns in the training data since it has more nodes, branches, and decision rules. However, increasing model complexity can also result in overfitting, when the model performs badly on unobserved data because it fits the training data too closely. Pruning is a method for managing decision tree complexity and avoiding overfitting. To shrink the size of the tree and streamline the decision rules, it entails eliminating or merging nodes. Pre-pruning and post-pruning are the two basic pruning strategies. Pre-pruning can assist manage a tree's intricacy from the beginning, preventing overgrowth and overfitting. If the tree is not let to extract enough information from the training data, it could result in underfitting.
