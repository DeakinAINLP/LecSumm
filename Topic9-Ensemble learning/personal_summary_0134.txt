  This topic's main topic is nonlinear models. Including KNN, decision tree, python practice  KNN  It  is  an  algorithm  that  assigns  weights  to  the  contributions  of  a  data  point's  neighbors. The larger the neighborâ€™s distance, the lower its weight. The most important parameters are the number of optimal neighbors (K) and the distance algorithm. It has good predictive ability.  decision tree  It  is  an  algorithm  that  represents  rules  based on  the  classification.  It  can  handle  categorical variables. It is easy to overfit the data. It needs to set parameters and must do pre-pruning and post- pruning must.  python practice  Using Python  to  implement KNN  and  decision  trees. Explore  the K-value  of  KNN and  the impact of different distance algorithms. Explore the construction of decision trees, such as depth and minimum nodes, etc.
