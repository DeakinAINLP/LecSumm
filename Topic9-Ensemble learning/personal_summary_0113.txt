 This topic mainly talks about the KNN algorithm and the Decision Tree algorithm. To begin with, It illustrates how KNN is used to classify data by using some vivid graphs. Shepardâ€™s method is also introduced through text and provided videos. Subsequently, it elaborates on how to calculate the best K value.  Then it starts to introduce Decision Tree. It first introduces the implementation of regression trees and classification trees, then it introduces decision tree algorithms. After that, it elaborates on how to prune a tree to decrease the complexity of the model. Finally, it summarizes the pros and cons of decision trees. Some extracurricular reading is also provided for me to broaden my knowledge such as the selection of distance metrics for KNN. The KNN and Decision Tree implementation in Python also impressed me. During studying this part, I reference lots of references varying from online to books.
