 KNN algorithm and its variants:  The KNN (k-nearest neighbors) algorithm is a simple yet effective classification and regression method. It operates based on the principle that similar data points tend to have similar labels or values. Here's a brief overview of the KNN algorithm and its variants:  KNN Algorithm:  1.  Training: The algorithm stores the training dataset, which consists of labeled examples.  2.  Prediction: a. For classification: Given a new, unlabeled data point, the algorithm calculates the distances between this point and all the training data points. b. For regression: Instead of calculating distances, KNN computes the average or weighted average of the K nearest neighbors' values.  3.  Finding nearest neighbors: The K nearest data points with the smallest distances to the new  point are selected.  4.  Labeling or regression estimation: a. For classification: The most common class label among the K nearest neighbors is assigned to the new point. b. For regression: The average or weighted average of the K nearest neighbors' values is assigned to the new point.  KNN Variants:  1.  Weighted KNN: Assigns weights to the neighbors based on their distances. Closer neighbors have  higher weights, influencing the prediction more than distant neighbors.  2.  Distance-weighted KNN: Similar to weighted KNN, but the weights are calculated based on the inverse of the distances. Closer neighbors have higher weights, inversely proportional to their distances.  3.  KNN with feature weighting: Adjusts the importance of different features by assigning weights to them, allowing the algorithm to consider the relevance of each feature during the distance calculation.  4.  Radius-based KNN: Considers a fixed radius instead of a fixed number of neighbors. It includes all  data points within the specified radius in the prediction.  5.  KNN with cross-validation: Involves partitioning the training dataset into multiple folds and iteratively evaluating the algorithm's performance by using different subsets of the data for training and testing.  These variants of KNN provide flexibility in adapting the algorithm to different scenarios and improving its performance by incorporating additional considerations, such as feature weighting, distance weighting, or radius-based prediction.
