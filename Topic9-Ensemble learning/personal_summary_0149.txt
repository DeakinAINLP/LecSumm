K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier algorithm used in machine learning. It works by finding the distances between a query and all the examples in the data, selecting the specified number of examples (K) closest to the query, and then classifying the query based on the most common class among its K-nearest neighbors. KNN is a distance-based algorithm that assumes that similar things exist in proximity. The KNN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity.  Decision Trees are a type of supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and regression problems. A decision tree is a model composed of a collection of "questions" organized hierarchically in the shape of a tree. Decision trees are simple to understand, interpret, and visualize, and can handle both numerical and categorical data. The tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision nodes and leaves. Decision trees are a way of modelling decisions and outcomes, mapping decisions in a branching structure.  Regression trees are a variant of decision trees that aim to predict outcomes that are real numbers, such as the optimal prescription dose for a patient. A regression tree is an algorithm where the target variable is continuous, and the tree is used to predict its value. Regression trees use decision trees in which the target variables can take continuous values instead of class labels in leaves. The Regression Tree Algorithm can be used to find one model that results in good predictions for new data. Regression trees are used when the response variable is continuous.  Classification trees are a type of decision tree used in machine learning where the target variable is categorical. In classification trees, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees are among the most popular machine learning algorithms given their intelligibility and simplicity. A decision tree is a model composed of a collection of "questions" organized hierarchically in the shape of a tree. Decision trees can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decisions making.  Pruning is a technique used to reduce the complexity of decision trees by removing parts of the tree that are not useful or do not improve the accuracy of the model. Pruning helps to avoid overfitting, which occurs when the tree is too deep or too complex and memorizes the training data instead of generalizing to new data.
