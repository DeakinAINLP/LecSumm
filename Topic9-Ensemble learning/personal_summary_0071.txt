 Some of the key areas you will explore this topic are listed below:    K nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm   Decision tree (DT)  KNN Algorithms and Its Variants:  KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) algorithm is a non-parametric and “lazy” learning algorithm commonly used for classification and regression problems.  It predicts the class of an unknown observation based on the majority class of its nearest neighbours. KNN has several variants such as weighted KNN, collaborative KNN, and KNN with kernel density estimation.  Theory of KNN:  KNN assumes that similar things are closer to each other which is potentially good and bad depending on the data set and analysis I want to do.  The algorithm uses distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski distance to calculate the distance between the new observation and its neighbours. The number of neighbours (K) to decide on which hyperparameter I use for optimal performance.  Best Number of Neighbours(K):  The choice of the optimal value of K depends on the dataset and the problem. A small value of K can lead to overfitting, while a large value can lead to the opposite underfitting. The best value of K is determined by testing different values and then evaluating their performance using the likes of cross-validation.  Decision Trees:  Decision Trees are non-parametric models that use a tree-like structures to model decisions based on a set of rules. I was familiar with various types of trees from data structure and algorithms. They can be used for classification, regression, and multi-output problems. A decision tree consists of nodes, edges, and leaves, where each node represents a decision based on a feature value, and each edge represents the outcome of the decision.      Regression Trees:  Regression Trees are decision trees used for regression problems. They predict the continuous target variable by splitting the dataset into subsets based on the values of the features.  Classification Trees:  Classification Trees are decision trees used for classification problems. They predict the categorical target variable by splitting the dataset into subsets based on the values of the features.  Decision Tree Algorithms:  There are several algorithms to construct decision trees, such as ID3, C4.5, CART, and Random Forest. These algorithms differ in the criteria used to split the dataset, such as entropy, Gini index, or information gain.  Model Complexity and Pruning:  Decision trees can be prone to overfitting, resulting in a complex and unstable model. Therefore, it is important to control the model complexity and prune the tree by removing unnecessary branches to improve its generalization performance.  Decision Tree Advantages and Disadvantages:  The advantages of decision trees are their interpretability, ease of use, and ability to handle non-linear relationships. However, decision trees can be sensitive to small variations in the data and can be prone to overfitting, resulting in a complex and unstable model.  Impact of Distance Metrics on KNN Performance:  The choice of the distance metric can significantly impact the performance of the KNN algorithm. The Euclidean distance is commonly used for continuous variables, while the Hamming distance is used for categorical variables.  Feature Importance of Using Decision Trees:  Decision trees can be used to determine the importance of features in a dataset. The importance of a feature is measured by the reduction in impurity or entropy caused by its use in splitting the dataset. The most important features are those that lead to the largest reduction in impurity or entropy.
