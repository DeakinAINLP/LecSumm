This topic introduced the topic of neural networks and deep learning.  Neural Networks  Neural Networks are designed to emulate the structure of the human brain to create a model which can learn and adapt to the data presented to them in a ‘human like’ way. Neural networks are structured as a series of interconnected nodes/neurons which form pathways between and inputs and outputs.  Backpropagation  Neural Networks use Backpropagation as a way to train models – providing ‘feedback’ on how something performed in order to update and adjust performance for next time. This involves comparing expected values with actual results and updating weights throughout the network accordingly. Over time, the network learns the how to reach the expected outcomes correctly.  Perceptron  A perceptron is a single layer neural network which is used for binary classification on linearly separable data.  Multi Later Perceptron (MLP)  Multilayered perceptrons combine together many perceptrons which can handle simple questions individually. When linked together many perceptrons can solve more complex, non linearly seperable questions, including both classification and regression problems. An MLP is made up of an input layer, one or many hidden layers and an output layer.
