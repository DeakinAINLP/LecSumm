 Neural networks are machine learning models inspired by the function of the human brain. The consist of multiple layers including the input layer, the hidden layer(s) and the output layer, all of which can be of varying dimensions.  Preceptron algorithm is a single layer network used for binary classification. It iteratively updates the weights based on the input features to minimize incorrect classification.  Multilayer perceptron is a neural network with multiple layers. It builds upon the perceptron algorithm by introducing the hidden layers for weight adjustments. This  algorithm can be used on both regression and classification problems.  Backpropagation in neural networks refers to the process of training the neural  network by feeding the error between the predicted and desired output, and using  that to adjust the weights. This is in contrast to feedforward which has data flow from  one end of the neural network to the other without any cycle of data.
