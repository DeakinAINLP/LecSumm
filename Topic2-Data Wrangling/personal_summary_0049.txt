 This topic we covered non-linear models. Which includes neural networks, perceptron, and multilayer perceptron and, deep learning.  A motivation for neural networks comes from understanding our human brains.  Multiplayer perceptron, also known as MLP is a type of neural network where the mapping between input and output is non-linear.  Backpropagation, also known as Backward Propagation of Errors, it is a technique used to train neural networks by adjusting the weights between neurons.  Deep learning has many real-world applications, such as image recognition (handwriting detection, number plate recognition).
