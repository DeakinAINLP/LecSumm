-  Neural Networks also known as artificial neural networks (ANNS) is a method that teaches  computers to process data in methods that are inspired by humans brains.  -  Major players in neural network, input layer, one or more hidden layer, combiners (sum  function), non  linear activation function, output layer.  - -  Perceptron is a linear classifier (single layer) , a multi-layer perceptron is called a neural network  -  Data that can not be linearly separated by a line require new neural network.  -  A feedforward neural network is an Artificial neural network where the connection between units do not form a cycle. The information only moves in one direction forwards, through the hidden nodes and to the output nodes  -  Multi layer feed forward neural networks also known as Multi layer perceptron (MLP) -  Backpropagation algorithm Is used to train the MLPS  -
