Summary Topic 10   Topic 10 is more focused on neural networks, perceptron and multilayer perceptron and  deep learning   The figure below shows how major layers make up the neural network system:     We note that the more layers we add onto it, the more complex the neural network becomes   A perceptron is a linear classifier and relates to a single layer neural network while a multi-  layer perceptron is referred to as a neural network   An illustration of a perceptron is shown below:        A  feedforward  neural  network  is  an  Artificial  Neural  Network  (ANN)  where  interconnections between units do not form a cycle.   A  multi-layer  feed-forward  Neural  Network  (NN)  is  also  known  as  a  Multi-layer  Perceptron (MLP).   As we already know, the core concept of training MLP is a stochastic gradient-descent rule
