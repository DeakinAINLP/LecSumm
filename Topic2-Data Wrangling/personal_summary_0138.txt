 The Main points that I’ve covered in the tenth topic are as follows:  ➢  I have understood the concept of Perceptron algorithm and Neural system basics. ➢  I got the knowledge of Deep learning and Back propagation algorithm. ➢  I studied the different tuning parameters and different activation functions to solve a  neural network problem.  My Learning summary Based on 10th Topics Lecture was gaining Knowledge of Deep Learning and Different Neural networks such as Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Where the CNN the convolutional layer will calculate the scalar product between the weights of the neurones and the area related to the input volume to identify the output of neurones connected to local input regions. And Pooling layer will perform down sampling within the activation function.  Knowledge gained with Lecture slides.  In the Overall topic 10 I have explored different Algorithms for Neural network such as Back propagation Algorithm and Perceptron Algorithm and the math behind these algorithms. I have studied the application of as Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) and implemented on CIFAR dataset. At last, I have also practically implemented Deep Learning with python using MNIST data where I have trained neural network on MNIST dataset by providing activation function as “Relu” and solver as ‘SGD’.  Hence the Topic Tenth was very useful and interesting by understanding the concept of Neural networks and tuning parameters and implemented in task 10.1P.
