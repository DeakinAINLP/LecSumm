 Deep learning is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge. It is a subset of machine learning that uses mathematical functions to map the input to the output. These functions can extract non-redundant information or patterns from the data, which enables them to form a relationship between the input and the output. Deep learning programs require access to immense amounts of training data and processing power to achieve an acceptable level of accuracy.  Deep learning works by using algorithms in a hierarchy that applies a nonlinear transformation to its input and uses what it learns to create a statistical model as output. Iterations continue until the output has reached an acceptable level of accuracy. The number of processing layers through which data must pass is what inspired the label ‘deep’.  Backpropagation is an algorithm used in deep learning to train neural networks. It is a way of propagating the total loss back into the neural network to know how much of the loss every node is responsible for, and subsequently updating the weights in a way that minimizes the loss by giving the nodes with higher error rates lower weights, and vice versa.
