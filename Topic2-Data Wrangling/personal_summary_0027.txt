Input layer  Neural Network: computational model inspired by human brain. Neural network components include: - -  Activation function -  Hidden layers -  Combiners (sum functions) -  Output layer  Perceptron: single layer neural network which is linearly separable.  Multilayer perceptron: feedforward neural network which contain many hidden layers.  Propagation: algorithm used in training data so that the model can learn to update weights and biases.  -  Forward propagation: input data is put through the neural network to compute the  output.  -  Backward propagation: calculate the gradient of loss function so that optimization  process can update weights and biases.  Deep Learning: a type of machine learning which focuses on building artificial neural networks with multiple layers. Deep learning includes:  -  Convolutional networks -  Autoencoders -  Deep belief networks -  Deep neural networks -  Boltzmann Machines -  Deep Boltzmann machines
