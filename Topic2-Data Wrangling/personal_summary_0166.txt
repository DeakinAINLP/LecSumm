TOPIC 10: NONLINEAR MODELS (neural networks and deep learning)  Concept of motivation and inspiration, neural network allow the  ● feature of transformation to the learnt from data. The use of ANN to study and model the brain and the use of brain as the motivation to design ANNs as effective machine learning. The brain function as well as neurons.  The neural basic system, learning the input layer that is  ● responsible for taking the input features.  Learning the similarity between human brain and artificial neural  ● networks.  Understanding perception algorithm, perception is a linear  ● classifier and is a single layer neural network.  The use of neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) to  ● play a snake game by evolving an Ai since NEAT is a neuroevolutive genetic machine learning algorithm. The game is played using IJKL keys of the keyboard.  Motivation for a multilayer perception, it can represent the XOR  ● problem.  Understanding Multilayer perceptron, it is a supplement feed  ● forward neural network. It consists of the input layer, output layer and the hidden layer.  ●  The concept of MLP formulation. Gradient-based optimisation methods are operated with the  ● search directions defined by the gradient of the function at the current point. ● to test for errors working back from output nodes to input nodes. ●  The concept of Python programming in perception and MLP.  The backpropagation algorithm, it is an algorithm that is designed  Understanding deep learning as it is designed to continually  ● analyse data with a logic structure similar to how human will draw conclusions.  Convolutional Neural Networks, it is modelled after the  ● mammalian visual cortex, the part of the brain where visual data is processed.  ●  The application of CNN, in CIFAR 10 dataset.  Concept of Autoencoder as it is a neural network which can handle  ● hidden layers in its structure.  ●  Understanding deep learning in python, running various codes.
