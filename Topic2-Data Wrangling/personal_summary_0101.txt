TOPIC 10: Nonlinear models (neural networks and deep learning)  10.2 Motivation and inspiration  Artificial Neural Networks are supposed to emulate somewhat the way the neurons in the human brain work. They are good at dealing with overwhelmingly nonlinear problems.  10.3 Neural system basics  A neural network system works in layers that are structured like this:  They an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer. It also has nonlinear activation functions, an example of which would be something like ReLu.  ANN’s can be very complex and take in high dimensional input data.   10.4 Perceptron algorithm  W1…Wn represent weights that adjust the input values of X1…Xm. W0 is the bias term.   10.6 Multilayer perceptron  Notes on MLP    the output is a vector   there are two kinds of weights here:    input → hidden    hidden → output     from  input →    hidden    from  hidden →    output   the input layer does no computation - it only relays the input vector   it can have more than one hidden layer   another interesting feature is that it does not have to be fully connected.  10.7 Backpropagation Algorithm  10.10 Convolutional Neural Networks  10.11 Application of CNN
