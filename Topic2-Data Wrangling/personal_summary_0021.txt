Artificial neural networks: inspired by the biological neural system. It is a highly complex and is compatible with high dimensional inputs and multi-label classification. The main components are:  -  The input layer. -  Various hidden layers. -  Combiners (sum functions). -  Nonlinear activation functions. -  Output layer.  Perceptron algorithm: a linear classifier that is a single layer with one node. Multiple-layer perceptron are called a neural network. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) The motivation to develop a multilayer perceptron is to resolve the issue faced when trying to separate data points based on their classes using a single line. Neural networks capture the complex relationships through multiple layers of interconnected neurons. Backpropagation algorithm  -  Used to train MLP â€“ based on the stochastic gradient-descent rule. -  Used to train neural network by adjusting the weights between neurons.  Deep learning An advanced neural network that uses layered structure if algorithms. Example of deep learning architectures:  -  Convolutional neural networks: most commonly used to analyze images. -  Autoencoders: neural network that handles many hidden layers within a structure. -  Deep brief networks -  Deep neural networks
