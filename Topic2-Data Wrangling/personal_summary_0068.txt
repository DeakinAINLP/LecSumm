Topics Covered This Topic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) ANNs  are  computing  systems  inspired  by  the  biological  neural  networks  of  the  human  brain.  They consist of interconnected artificial neurons, which process and transmit information through weighted connections.  Neural Networks Neural networks are a subset of machine learning algorithms that imitate how neurons in the human brain process information. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, which process and transmit data to achieve complex tasks like pattern recognition and prediction.  Neural System Basics The  foundation of  neural systems  is  the  biological  neuron,  the  primary  component  of  the  nervous system.  ANNs  attempt  to  replicate  the  functioning  of  these  biological  neurons  through  artificial neurons, organised in layers and connected by weighted connections.  Feedforward Neural Networks These are a type of ANN where information flows in a single direction, from the input layer to the output layer. They are commonly used for tasks like classification, regression, and prediction.  Perceptrons Perceptrons are the simplest form of feedforward neural network, consisting of a single neuron with adjustable weights. They can learn linearly separable patterns through an iterative process of weight adjustments.  Multilayer Perceptrons MLPs are an extension of perceptrons, with multiple layers of neurons that can learn more complex, non-linear patterns. They are feedforward neural networks often used for classification, regression, and prediction tasks.  Deep learning Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with many layers (deep neural  networks).  These  networks  can  learn  more  abstract  and  complex  representations,  enabling them  to  perform  advanced  tasks  like  image  recognition,  natural  language  processing,  and reinforcement learning.  Gradient-based Optimisation This  technique  optimises  a  neural  network's  weights  by  minimising  a  loss  function.  It  involves calculating the gradient of the loss function  concerning the weights and then updating the weights based on the gradient.  Backpropagation Algorithm Backpropagation is a widely-used algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. It calculates the gradient of the loss function concerning each weight by propagating the error back through the web, then adjusts the weights to minimise the error.
