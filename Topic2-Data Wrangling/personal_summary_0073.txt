 This topic we explore some fascinating related concepts:    neural networks   perceptron and multilayer perceptron   deep learning  Motivation and inspiration  Interestingly the motivation behind Neural networks stems from the design of our own brains, we have a lot of interconnected neurons and highly parallel architecture to allow us to think and exist in the manner we do.  We created this concept for ANNs because linear models are not always sufficient when decision boundaries are very nonlinear.  Support vector machines can construct nonlinear functions but use fixed feature transformations which depends on the kernel function.  Neural networks also allow the feature transformations to be learnt from data.  Neural System Basics  This topic, we began by delving into the fundamentals of neural systems, which form the basis of modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.    Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and function, consisting of interconnected nodes or neurons. These neurons process and transmit information, enabling the network to learn patterns and make predictions. Studying neural systems allowed us to understand the core concepts of AI and provided a strong foundation for our exploration of more advanced techniques, like perceptrons and deep learning.  Perceptron Algorithm  Our next topic was the perceptron algorithm, one of the earliest neural network models, introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. A perceptron consists of a single layer of neurons, which receive input signals, apply an activation function, and produce an output signal.  The perceptron algorithm updates the weights of the input connections to minimize the classification error, learning linearly separable patterns in the process. Studying the perceptron algorithm was beneficial in understanding the limitations of simple neural networks and motivated us to explore more sophisticated architectures like multilayer perceptrons.  Motivation for multilayer perceptron  Upon realizing the limitations of the perceptron algorithm, particularly its inability to solve non- linearly separable problems, we were motivated to explore more complex neural networks. This led      us to the concept of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which are feedforward networks with multiple layers of interconnected neurons. MLPs can model more intricate relationships between inputs and outputs, enabling them to solve a broader range of problems.  Multilayer Perceptron  The study of MLPs introduced us to the intricacies of more complex neural networks. We learned that an MLP consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.  By using non-linear activation functions and multiple layers, MLPs can learn non-linear patterns in the input data. We discussed the challenges of training such networks, which led us to the backpropagation algorithm.  Backpropagation Algorithm  To address the challenges of training multilayer perceptron’s, we delved into the backpropagation algorithm. This algorithm is a supervised learning technique that minimizes the network's error by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons.   It involves computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each weight, which is then used to update the weights. Understanding the backpropagation algorithm is important for our grasp of how complex neural networks learn and adapt.  Introduction to deep learning  With a strong foundation in neural networks and multilayer perceptron’s, we embarked on our journey into deep learning. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that employs deep neural networks with many layers, enabling them to learn complex patterns and representations from large amounts of data.    Convolutional Neural networks  We then explored convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a specialized deep learning architecture designed to process grid-like data, such as images. CNNs use convolutional layers, which apply filters to local regions of the input data to detect features and pooling layers This then reduces the spatial dimensions of the data.  These layers enable CNNs to learn hierarchical representations of data, making them highly effective in image recognition and classification tasks.  Application of CNN  In this topic I studied various applications of convolutional neural networks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.  I also investigated how CNNs have been employed in medical imaging, self-driving cars, and facial recognition systems as some world applications of CNN.  Autoencoder  We proceeded to learn about autoencoders, a type of unsupervised deep learning architecture used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning.     Autoencoders consist of two parts, an encoder that maps input data to a lower-dimensional representation.  Then a decoder that reconstructs the original data from this lower-dimensional representation.  By minimizing the reconstruction error, autoencoders can learn compact and useful representations of the input data, which can then be used for tasks such as denoising, anomaly detection, and pretraining other deep learning models.  Deep Learning with Python  IN this last section we looked at practical implementations, a popular programming language with extensive support for machine learning and data science libraries. We learned how to use TensorFlow, deep learning frameworks that provide high-level APIs for building and training neural networks.
