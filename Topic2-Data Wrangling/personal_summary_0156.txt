 The lectures this topic concentrated on the perceptron algorithm, multilayer perceptrons, and the backpropagation algorithm for neural network training. The MLP is a multilayer neural network that adds hidden layers and nonlinear activation functions to get over the perceptron's constraints. The MLP is more effective at modelling tasks and can describe intricate, nonlinear decision surfaces. When linear models or fixed feature transformations are unable to adequately address complicated, nonlinear issues, neural networks are used. The perceptron is a linear classifier and a single-layer neural network. It uses a hyperplane to divide the input space into two sections.
