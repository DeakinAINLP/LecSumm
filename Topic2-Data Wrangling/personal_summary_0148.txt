This topic we explored the concepts of neural networks, perceptron, multilayer perceptron and deep learning.  Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, called neurons which are organized in layers. The output from one layer of neurons becomes the input for the next layer, allowing for complex information processing.  A perceptron is a basic unit of computation in neural networks. It takes inputs, applies weights and bias, and uses an activation function to produce an output. By combining perceptrons in multiple layers, neural networks can learn and make predictions based on patterns in data.  If the input vector is X = [x1, x2, ..., xn] and a weight vector W = [w1, w2, ..., wn], the perceptron produces an output y and linear combiner (z)of the inputs and weights:  z = x1*w1 + x2*w2 + ... + xn*wn y = sign[ v(x,w)]  Similarly, a multilayer perceptron is a neural network with multiple layers of interconnected perceptrons. It takes input data, performs calculations in each layer and produces an output. The multiple layers help the network learn complex patterns.  Deep learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its success in various domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and several other applications. Deep learning refers to a specific subfield of machine learning that focuses on training deep neural networks. Deep neural networks are neural networks with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers which allows the data to learn hierarchical representation of data.
