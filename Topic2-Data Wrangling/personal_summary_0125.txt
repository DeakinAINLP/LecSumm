 The topics that were covered during topic 10 were concepts focusing neural networks, perceptron, and multilayer perceptron, Deep learning. Then, implementation of perceptron and MLP in python and also deep learning in python.  I referred to the unit site contents for learning the topics that were covered in topic 10 along with the external video links and articles provided.  The learning journey started with the basic understanding of Neural network along with neurons and brain function, neural system basics also its complexity. I gained an idea on the concept of perceptron algorithm which is a linear classifier. Then, I gathered knowledge about multilayer perceptron which is a model that comprises multiple layers of logistic regression like models rather than multiple perceptron, MLP formulation. Then, learnt about backpropagation algorithm, which is used for training MLPâ€™s, introduction to deep learning model which is designed to continually analyze data with a logistic structure similar how human drew conclusions. I gained an understanding of Convolutional neural networks(CNN) which are made up of three concepts namely sparse interactions, parameter sharing and translation invariance. Then, applications of CNN out of bag error and Autoencoder which is a neural network which can handle many hidden layers in its structure was learnt. Finally, I acquired knowledge on implementation of perceptron and MLP in python , deep learning in python.
