Topic 10 Deep learning Neural system  ● Basic building blocks of neural networks. ● Inspired by the structure and function of neurons in the human brain. ● Each neuron receives input, processes it, and produces an output. ● Neurons are organized into layers. ● Input layer: The ﬁrst layer in the network, receives input data. ● Hidden layer(s): Layers between the input and output layers, perform complex  transformations.  ● Output layer: The last layer in the network, produces the ﬁnal output or  prediction.  Perceptron algorithm  ● The perceptron algorithm is a simple linear binary classiﬁer. ● It separates data into two classes by learning a linear decision boundary ● The perceptron updates its weights iteratively based on the misclassiﬁed  examples.  ● If a data point is misclassiﬁed, the perceptron adjusts the weights in the  direction of the correct class.  ● The perceptron algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the data is linearly  separable.  ● However, if the data is not linearly separable, the algorithm may not ﬁnd a  perfect decision boundary and can oscillate indeﬁnitely.  Backpropagation Algorithm:  ● The backpropagation algorithm trains Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) by  iteratively adjusting the network's weights and biases based on the calculated error gradients during a backward pass, allowing the network to learn and improve its performance over time. Convolutional Neural Networks  ● CNNs utilize convolutional layers that apply ﬁlters (kernels) to input data,  capturing local patterns and features. These layers have learnable parameters, enabling the network to automatically learn relevant features from the data. Application of CNN  ● CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks such as image classiﬁcation, object detection, image segmentation, and facial recognition. They have signiﬁcantly advanced the ﬁeld by achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and enabling automated analysis of visual data.  Autoencoder  ● A neural network architecture that learns to compress and reconstruct input data, enabling tasks such as dimensionality reduction, data denoising, and feature learning.
