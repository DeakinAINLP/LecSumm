 Topic -10 gave the details of the basics of  non-linear models including neural network and  deep learning. Some of the important points are listed below:  1.  Neural networks are inspired by the human brain's neuronal structure. It is a series of  algorithms that identifies underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that  mimics human brain operations [1].  2.  The perceptron algorithm is one of the simplest types of artificial neural network and  is the foundation for more complex neural networks. It is a linear classifier used for  binary predictions. Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning and it helps the  learning model to classify the given input data.[2]  3.  A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network that  consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output  layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation  function [3].  4.  Backpropagation is a method used in artificial neural networks to calculate a gradient  that is needed in the calculation of the weights to be used in the network [4].  5.  Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is a neural network with three or  more  layers.  These  neural  networks  attempt  to  simulate  the  behavior  of  the  human  brain—albeit far from matching its ability—in order to "learn" from large amounts of  data [5].  6.  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  are  deep  learning  algorithms  that  are  particularly powerful for processing grid-like data such as images. CNNs are built on    the  concept  of  convolutional  layers  where  the  model  is  able  to  automatically  and  adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features [7].
