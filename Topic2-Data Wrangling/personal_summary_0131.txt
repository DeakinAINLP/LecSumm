 Ans: A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.  ➢  The Perceptron algorithm is a two-class (binary) classification machine learning algorithm. It is a type of neural network model, perhaps the simplest type of neural network model. It consists of a single node or neuron that takes a row of data as input and predicts a class label.  ➢  A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a deep, artificial neural network. A neural network is comprised of layers of nodes which activate at various levels depending on the previous layer’s nodes. ➢  When thinking about neural networks, it may be helpful to isolate your thinking to a single node  in the network.  ➢  Backpropagation algorithm is used to effectively train a neural network through a method  called chain rule. In simple terms, after each forward pass through a network, backpropagation performs a backward pass while adjusting the model’s parameters (weights and biases).  ➢  Deep learning is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in  a way that is inspired by the human brain.  ➢  Deep learning models can recognize complex patterns in pictures, text, sounds, and other data  to produce accurate insights and predictions.  ➢  CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution in place of general matrix multiplication  in at least one of their layers.[2] They are specifically designed to process pixel data and are used in image recognition and processing.  ➢  CNN have 3-dimensional layers in a width, height, and depth manner. All neurons in a particular layer are not connected to the neurons in the previous layer. Instead, a layer is only connected to a small portion of neurons in the previous layer.  ➢  The aim of an Autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for  the purpose of dimensionality reduction.
