In this topic has explore the nonlinear models (neural networks , perception and some deep learning model).  Neural networks allow the feature transformations to be learnt from data. In neural networks need to have input layer, hidden layer and output layer. AS the number of hidden  layers  increase  the  model  getting  more  complex  and  it  can  work.  Based  on  the complexity of the data so it can learn better if the model is getting more complex.  For the output layer, the number of neurons in the output layer it depends on the type of the problem. A perception is a single layer neural network which essentially consists of some of the input data.
