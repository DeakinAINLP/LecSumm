1.  Mo#va#on and inspira#on behind machine learning: Machine learning derives its inspira3on from the human brain and its ability to learn from experience. It seeks to create algorithms and systems that improve performance with exposure to more data.  2.  Basics  of  neural  systems:  Neural  systems  or  ar3ﬁcial  neural  networks  are  computa3onal models  inspired  by  the  human  brain.  They  consist  of  interconnected  processing  nodes,  or "neurons", that process and transmit informa3on, making them eﬃcient in paEern recogni3on tasks.  3.  The Perceptron algorithm and its applica#ons: The Perceptron is a binary classiﬁer algorithm used in supervised learning. It is a precursor to neural networks and is typically used for binary classiﬁca3on tasks, such as spam detec3on or image recogni3on.  4.  Understanding and implemen#ng mul#layer perceptrons: Mul3layer perceptrons, a kind of feed-forward neural network, have an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Training involves tweaking the weights and biases using methods like backpropaga3on to minimize error.  5.  Backpropaga#on algorithm for training neural networks: Backpropaga3on is a method used in neural networks to adjust the weights and biases in response to errors. It propagates the error  backward  from  the  output  to  the  input  layer,  adjus3ng  model  parameters  for  beEer future predic3ons.  6.  7.  Introduc#on  to  Python  programming  for  machine  learning:  Python  is  a  versa3le  language commonly used in machine learning due to its simple syntax, extensive library support such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, and strong community backing.  Introduc#on  to  deep  learning  and  its  concepts:  Deep  learning  is  a  subﬁeld  of  machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks). It is par3cularly eﬀec3ve  in  dealing  with  unstructured  data  and  excels  in  areas  such  as  image  and  speech recogni3on.  8.  Convolu#onal  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  and  their  applica#ons:  CNNs  are  deep  learning models primarily used in image recogni3on and processing. They include convolu3onal layers that  scan  input  for  paEerns,  reducing  the  number  of  parameters  and  making  the  network more eﬃcient.  9.  Exploring the applica#on of CNNs in various domains: CNNs ﬁnd applica3ons in areas such as facial  recogni3on,  autonomous  driving,  medical  imaging,  and  more,  due  to  their  ability  to process and classify images with high accuracy.  10. Auto-encoders and their role in deep learning: Autoencoders are neural networks used for data compression and noise reduc3on. They learn to encode input data and then reconstruct it, oYen used for dimensionality reduc3on and denoising.
