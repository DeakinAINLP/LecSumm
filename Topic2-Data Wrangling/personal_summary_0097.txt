This topic we covered the concept of deep learning, focusing specifically on artificial neural networks.  Neural networks (ANN)– A machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Composed of multiple interconnected layers of nodes or "neurons", where each layer takes inputs, performs computations on them, and passes the results to the next layer.  Input Layer: First layer in the network, where the raw data is inputted.     Hidden Layers: The layers in between the input and output layers. The computations and transformations happen in these layers. There could be a single hidden layer or multiple, depending on the complexity of the problem.    Output Layer: The final layer that provides the output of the network, based on the  computations and transformations of the previous layers.  Perceptron – A simple type of neural network/fundamental building block for more complex neural networks. It is a binary classifier that decides whether an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to a certain specific class.  Multilayer Perceptron – Extends the concept of the simple perceptron by adding one or more hidden layers of neurons between the input and output layers.  Deep Learning – Term used to refer to neural networks with multiple layers between the input and output (hidden layers).  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)– A type of deep learning model that is predominantly used for tasks related to image processing.
