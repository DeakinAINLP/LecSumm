This topic, I studied neural networks and deep learning. I understood the motivation behind Neural Networks and studied the Perceptron algorithm. I also understood multilayer perceptron with its formulation and the motivation behind multilayer perceptron. I understood the concept of feedforward neural networks with the formulation. I saw the details of gradient-based optimization with its formulation. I understood the backpropagation algorithm with its formulation. I read about deep learning architectures. I understood the basics of convolutional neural networks and read about LeNet5 architecture and the example of the usage of convolutional neural networks. I read about and understood the autoencoder concept. I tried the Python code blocks given in the learning resources.
