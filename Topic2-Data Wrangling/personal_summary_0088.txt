 In this topic we have learn more about Nonlinear models (neural networks  and deep learning).  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing and analyzing visual data, such  as images or videos. They have found numerous applications across various domains. Here are some common applications of CNNs:  1. Image Classification:  CNNs excel in classifying images into different categories. They learn to extract features automatically from raw pixel data, enabling accurate classification of objects, scenes, or patterns.  2. Object Detection: CNNs can localize and identify multiple objects within an image. They are commonly used in applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance,  and image-based search.  3. Facial Recognition: CNNs are utilized for recognizing and verifying individuals' faces, enabling applications like biometric authentication and identity verification.  4. Image Segmentation: CNNs can partition images into different regions or segments based on their content. This is useful for tasks like medical image analysis, where identifying specific areas of interest is crucial.  5. Natural Language Processing (NLP):  CNNs can process text data, such as sentiment analysis, te xt classification, or document summarization. They operate on text representations like word embeddings or character sequences.         6. Video Analysis:  CNNs can analyze and process videos by extending their capabilities from image processing tasks. Applications include action recognition, video summarization, and video surveillance.  7. Medical Imaging: CNNs aid in medical diagnosis by analyzing medical images, such as X -rays, MRI scans, or pathology slides. They can assist in disease detection, tumor classification, and medical image segmentation.  Key concepts include convolutional layers, which perform localized feature extraction using filters, pooling layers, which downsample feature maps to reduce spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers, which integr ate extracted features for final classification or regression.  CNNs utilize backpropagation to iteratively adjust their internal parameters during training, aiming to minimize a specified loss function. The parameters are optimized using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants. Additionally, CNNs often incorporate activation functions like ReLU to introduce non -linearity and enable better representation learning.
