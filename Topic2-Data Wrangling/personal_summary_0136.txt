This topic's main topic is neural networks. Including perceptron, deep learning, python practice  sensor  It is a single layer neural network. A multilayer perceptron is called a neural network. Use AND and OR logic gates. For complex nonlinear decision surfaces, we need a multilayer network. It has two important parameters: Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. It measures the difference between the network's predicted and actual values. Backpropagation is used to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network weights.  deep learning  Deep learning focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, known  as  artificial  neural  networks.  There  are  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNN),  and autoencoders. CNNs have convolutional layers with learnable weights designed to learn the spatial hierarchy of features automatically and adaptively. CNN consists of three basic concepts: sparse interaction,  parameter  sharing,  and  translation  invariance. An  autoencoder  is  a  specific  type  of neural  network  architecture  used  for  unsupervised  learning.  Autoencoders  and  CNNs  can  be combined.  Python  Chopped perceptron exercises and CNN exercises using Python. Use preprocessing correctly.  Create models using deep learning with online data.
