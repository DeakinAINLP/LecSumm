Topic Ten explored into Perceptron’s and Neural Networks in relation to Deep Learning. To start we looked at the basics behind a Neural network and concept of a Perception, before briefly looking at applying Perceptron’s within Python.  These  fundamentals  were  then  taken  and  expanded  upon  into  Multilayer  Perception’s  and  their  Python applications were also covered. Finally, we touched on the core principles behind Deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks and Autoencoders, closing out with a deep learning example within Python.
