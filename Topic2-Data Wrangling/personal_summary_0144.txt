 In topic 10, we learned some concepts such as neural networks, perceptron and multilayer perceptron and deep learning. In machine learning, two groups of ANN researchers are working on this problem:one group uses ANN to study and model the brain and the other group uses the brain as the motivation to design ANNs as effective learning machines, which might not result in a true model of the brain. We follow the second groupâ€™s approach here.  Development of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is motivated by biological neural systems. The major players in a neural network system are a typical neural network (machine) has an input layer, it has one or many hidden layers, it has combiners (sum functions), it has nonlinear activation functions and it has an output layer.  Perceptron is a linear classifier and is a single layer neural network. A multi-layer perceptron is called a neural network. Not linearly separable problems were a motivation to develop a new neural network and later it was proven that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can represent the XOR problem. A feedforward neural network is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) where connections between units do not form a cycle. In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.  A deep learning model is designed to continually analyze data with a logic structure like how a human would draw conclusions. Also in topic 10, we learned how to apply CNN on real life problems.
