Topic 10 Learning Summary Report  Name: Viola Birech  Assignment: Task 10.1P  Institution: Deakin University  Date: 01/06/2023  1         Summary Report  Topic 10 Learning Summary  In topic 10 of our machine learning class, we covered a range of topics related to Nonlinear  models including neural networks, deep learning, perceptron and multilayer perceptron, the neural  system basics including how the brain works, perceptron algorithm where Perceptron is a linear  classifier (binary) and is a single layer neural network. A multi-layer perceptron is called a neural  network. Also, python programming was discussed and how perceptron and MLP is done in python.  Reflection  During topic 10 of my machine learning class, I studied various topics related to Nonlinear  models. I learned about how python is used to code and give outputs of perceptron and MLP. Overall,  I found the topic 10 topics very informative and relevant to the field of machine learning. I look  forward to applying these techniques in practical projects and experiments.  Summary of Reading List  The tenth section of the machine learning course incorporated a range of resources for  utilization which were all like the previous topicsâ€™ resources. I found these resources very helpful to  my understanding of the content studied. These readings consist of textbooks such as, Hands-On  Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow and Python Machine Learning  Other additional resources are the various code libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and  scikit-learn which can be heavily utilized to learn and practicalize the lessons learnt. Research papers  and articles from journals are also crucial resources to enhance investigation on current research areas  in the field of machine learning. Online platforms like Kaggle and Data Camp are also critical in  utilization as supplementary materials for practice exercises and tutorials.  2       Quiz Score  3
