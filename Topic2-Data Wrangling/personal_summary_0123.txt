Neural Networks There are three main components in neural networks: an input layer for receiving data needed for analyse, one or many hidden layers that use the data to formulate an expected outcome, and an output layer.  Perceptron algorithm A simple and fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It adjusts the weights to find the optimal decision boundary. However, it may not converge or produce accurate results for datasets that are not linearly separable due to the sensitivity to the initial weights and the order of the training examples.  Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Commonly used for a wide range of complex problems, such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition. In an MLP, the input data is passed through different layers of interconnected neurons, each layer solving a specific part of the problem. Then, the output of each neuron is passed on to the next neuron, until the final output is  produced as the final solution to the complex problem. The algorithm can handle both linear and nonlinear relationships in the data. However, it can be prone to overfitting if the model complexity is not properly controlled, and it requires enough labelled training data to achieve good performance. MLPs are commonly applied in image recognition, NLP, predictive modelling, medical diagnosis, and recommender systems.  Deep Learning These methods are built upon the concept of neural networks, which are computational models inspired by a logical structure like human brains. Various deep-learning architectures have been developed to address different types of tasks. Some popular architectures can be listed as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image and video processing, Autoencoders for image denoising and compression, and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) for image recognition, speech recognition, and NLP.
