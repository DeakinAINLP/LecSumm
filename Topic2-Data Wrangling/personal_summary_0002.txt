topic 10 covered neural networksï¼Œas the name suggests, neural networks are inspired by the brain the motivation behind this is to be able to create artificial systems that can learn, adapt, and process complex patterns in a similar way to how the human brain processes information. basics is composed of interconnected artificial neurons organised into layers: input hidden output. each neuron receives input processes it by applying a weighted sum followed by an activation function then sends the result to the next layer perceptron algorithm is a single-layered neural network used for binary classification learns by updating it's weights based on the errors it makes during training using an update rule. multilayer perceptron single-layered neural networks are limited in their ability to model complex functions multiplayer perceptrons overcome this limitation by adding additional layers known as hidden layers this allows the network to learn more complex things backpropagation a supervised learning algorithm used to train neural networks calculates the gradient of the loss function for each weight using the  chain rule, propagating the error backwards through the network the weights are then updated using an optimisation algorithm ie hopefully improving the model deep learning subset of ML encapsulates neural networks with a great deal of hidden layers due to the depth of these networks, they can learn very complex things these models are used in things like natural language processing, image recognition, and image generation. convolutional neural networks a type of neural network designed for processing grid-like data ie images they tend to have the following layers input (takes grid based data) convolution layer (detects patterns) activation layer (activation function) pooling layer (reduce spatial dimensions) classification layer (maps learned features to the target classes) output (final prediction) they perform well on tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. autoencoders an unsupervised neural network used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning consist of an encoder which maps input data to a lower dimensional representation and a decoder which reconstructs the input data from the compressed representation
