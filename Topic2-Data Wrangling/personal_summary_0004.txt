This  module  covered  Nonlinear  models,  specifically  Neural  Networks  NN  and  Deep  Learning.  We learned  that  a  Perceptron  is  a  single  layer  classification  network.  This  single  layer  network  is  an algorithm that can perform linear classification. The issue comes when you have non-linear data and need to perform something akin to an XOR where the data is not linearly separable. That is where multi-layer perceptronâ€™s, or NN come in which can perform solve both classification and regression problems. Deep learning is a neural network with many hidden layers (where s hidden layer is the layer that is not the input/output and is hidden from the user). An artificial Neural Network or ANN is an attempt to use the brain model as a basis for developing an ANN where the end goal is to create a brain like network that can learn. CNN on the other hand, typically for image classification, is a deep neural network that has a series of layers that perform more complex classifications, from light, dark, edge etc to cat or dog.
