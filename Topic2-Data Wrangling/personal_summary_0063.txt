 In this module we learnt about neural networks and deep learning. Here is a short summary: -  Feature changes can be learned from data using neural networks. The fundamental components of a neural network system are an input layer, one or more hidden layers, combiners, nonlinear activation functions, and an output layer. An input layer is a layer that receives information.  Features with multiple labels and high-dimensional inputs, neural networks can classify objects.  If not provided enough training data, a more complex neural network may become overfit.  We also learned about Perceptron which is a single layer neural network. A multi- layer perceptron is also known as a neural network. A neural network can represent the XOR problem as well.  For non-binary decisions we use neural networks as a single perceptron is unusable. In this unit we also learned about back propagation algorithm.  After learning about neural networks and perceptron and backpropagation, we used our theoretical knowledge to perform practical using various python libraries.
