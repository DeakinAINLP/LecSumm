In topic 10, we finished learning about nonlinear models, and for this topic, the main topics were neural networks and deep learning. We learned about the basics of neural networks and the structure they have in order to function, them being: an input layer, hidden layers, combiners, nonlinear activation functions, and an output layer. We looked at perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons and their relations to neural networks. We discussed the theory and algorithm of perceptrons, and how theyâ€™re used to solve real problems. We saw how this translated into deep learning and how these algorithms are designed to continuously absorb and analyze data with a logic structure. We were exposed to some deep learning architectures and how they came to be.
