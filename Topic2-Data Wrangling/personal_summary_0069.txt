In topic 10, we mainly learnt Nonlinear models (neural networks and deep learning)  Motivation for Neural Networks: The development of neural networks is motivated by the desire to mimic the human brain's processing ability to learn from experience. This approach seeks to emulate the biological neurons' structure and functioning in a simplified and abstracted manner. The hope is that neural networks, much like the brain, can learn to recognize patterns and make decisions based on these patterns. Another motivating factor is the ability of neural networks to learn and model non-linear and complex relationships, which makes them powerful tools for tasks such as image and speech recognition, language processing, and many other applications.  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): ANNs are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in brains. They are composed of layers of nodes, or "neurons," and each layer's output serves as the subsequent layer's input. ANNs can model and learn non-linear relationships due to their structure and the activation functions used in the neurons, which introduce nonlinearity.  Perceptron: The perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network, equivalent to a single neuron model. It was designed to classify binary data, i.e., data that can be divided into two classes. The perceptron receives multiple inputs, applies weights to those inputs, sums them, and passes them through an activation function to produce an output. The perceptron algorithm iteratively adjusts the weights based on the prediction errors it makes until it converges to a solution (if the data is linearly separable). The perceptron is the foundation for more complex neural networks.  Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP):        The motivation for developing the MLP arose from the limitations of the simple perceptron. A single-layer perceptron can only classify linearly separable data. Real-world data is often not linearly separable, hence the need for a more sophisticated model. An MLP consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer is fully connected to the next layer. The presence of one or more hidden layers allows the MLP to model non-linear relationships. Each neuron in the hidden layers can model different features, and when combined, they provide a powerful abstraction of the data.  Backpropagation: A key innovation that makes MLPs trainable is the backpropagation algorithm. It efficiently computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. Using this gradient, the weights can be iteratively adjusted to minimize the loss using gradient descent or more sophisticated optimization algorithms.  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): A special type of neural network designed for processing structured grid data such as images. CNNs have convolutional layers that apply filters to the input, enabling the model to automatically learn and abstract spatial hierarchies from the data.  Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subclass of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. The term "deep" refers to the number of layers in the network - the more layers, the deeper the network. Deep learning can learn to represent data in increasingly abstract ways, thanks to its deep structure, which can potentially consist of hundreds or thousands of layers.  Autoencoder: An autoencoder is a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, primarily for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. It has two main parts: an encoder, which compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional code, and a decoder, which reconstructs the input data from the code. The network is trained to minimize the difference between the input and the reconstruction. Variants like denoising autoencoders can handle noise in data, while Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) add a probabilistic twist, enabling generation of new data similar to the input.
