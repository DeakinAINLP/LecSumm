First, Iâ€™ve started begins with an exploration of the fundamentals of neural systems. I  explored  into  the  intricate  workings  of  neurons,  the  building  blocks  of  neural networks, and understand how they communicate through synapses. Then I learn about  the  activation  functions  that  determine  the  output  of  a  neuron  and  how these  interconnected  neurons  form  powerful  networks  capable  of  complex computations.  By  grasping  the  basics  of  neural  systems.  Then  I  encounter  the Perceptron algorithm, a fundamental concept in neural networks. The Perceptron algorithm enable to train a single-layer neural network to classify input data into different classes. By iteratively adjusting the weights associated with each neuron, the Perceptron algorithm learns to make accurate predictions.  The Multilayer Perceptron extends the capabilities of a single-layer neural network by  introducing  hidden  layers,  allowing  for  the  learning  of  complex  patterns.  The Backpropagation  algorithm  plays  a  crucial  role  in  training  multilayer  neural networks by iteratively adjusting the weights based on the computed error. This algorithm  enables  the  network  to  learn  from  mistakes  and  improve  its  accuracy over time.
