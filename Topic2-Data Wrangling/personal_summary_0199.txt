In this topic we covered non-linear models with a particular focus on neural networks such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Which work by feeding the input data through a series of diﬀerent neuron nodes and adjusting the weights of the connections between them until the desired result is achieved.  Reﬂection This topics tasks where simple enough but I think that I may have done something wrong in the python code as my MLP model is incredibly inaccurate and I am not sure why
