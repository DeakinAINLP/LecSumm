Throughout the topic, I had the opportunity to dive into the basics of neural systems, including the structure and function of neurons and neural networks. I then explored the perceptron algorithm, which uses weighted inputs and a threshold function for binary predictions, and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a more complex neural network that can solve intricate problems. To train MLPs effectively, we learned about the backpropagation algorithm, which adjusts weights and biases based on error gradients. Moving into more advanced concepts, I studied deep learning, focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image analysis and computer vision tasks. You explored the applications of CNNs, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, witnessing their impact on fields like healthcare and self-driving cars. Finally, we explored autoencoders, which are used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. Overall, I gained a mprehensive understanding of neural systems, foundational algorithms, deep learning principles, and their practical applications.
