In this topic we cover neural networks, perceptron and multilayer perceptron, and deep learning [1]. A neural network is a form of artificial intelligence that processes data in a simmer fashion the neutrons in a human brain [2]. This type of machine learning is considered deep learning because it uses these interconnected nodes like a brain to create a system where a program can learn from its errors and improve [2].  Deep learning is considered a type of machine learning that works with neural networks that are designed to imitate how humans think and learn [4].  Feed forward neural networks are artificial neural networks in which nodes do not form loops. This type of neural network is also known as a multi-layer neural network as all information is only passed forward [3].  A simple form of a feed-forward network is a multilayer perceptron [4]. Perceptron is an algorithm for binary classification where the units are arranged into a set of layers. Each layer contains identical units, and all the units are connected to each other on all the layers so that the network is fully connected [4].
