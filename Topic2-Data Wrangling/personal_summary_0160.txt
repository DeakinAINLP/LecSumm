This topic, I learned about the basics of neural systems and deep learning. I discovered that a neural network consists of various components, including an input layer, hidden layers, combiners (sum functions), nonlinear activation functions, and an output layer. These elements work together to process and analyze data.  I also explored the concept of complexity in neural networks. I learned that more complex networks with multiple hidden layers can handle nonlinear and non-separable problems more effectively. For example, the XOR problem, which is not linearly separable, can be solved using a multilayer perceptron.  Furthermore, I delved into the fundamentals of deep learning. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are designed to analyze data in a similar way to how humans draw conclusions. CNNs utilize sparse interactions, parameter sharing, and translation invariance to extract features from input data.
