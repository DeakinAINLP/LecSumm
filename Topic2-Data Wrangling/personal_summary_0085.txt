10.1P Non Linear Models (Neural Networks and Deep Learning)  A neural network is a computational model that takes inspiration from the structure and functioning of the human brain. It serves as a foundational component of deep learning, which is a specialized branch of machine learning. Essentially, a neural network consists of interconnected nodes known as artificial neurons or simply "neurons." These neurons are organized into layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The connections between neurons are represented by weights, which define the significance or strength of the connection.  The goal of the Perceptron algorithm is to classify input data into two distinct classes, commonly referred to as binary classification. It takes a set of input features and assigns weights to them, reflecting their relative importance. Here’s a breakdown of the Perceptron Algorithm…  ● Input Data: The Perceptron algorithm takes a set of input data points, where each data  point has a label indicating its class (e.g., positive or negative).  ● Initialization: The algorithm starts by assigning random or preset values to the weights and bias associated with the artificial neuron. These weights determine the impact of each input feature on the neuron's output.  ● Activation Function: The Perceptron employs a step or threshold function as its  activation function. It calculates the weighted sum of the inputs and compares it to a threshold. If the sum surpasses the threshold, the neuron outputs one class (e.g., positive); otherwise, it outputs the other class (e.g., negative).  ● Training Loop: The algorithm iterates over the input data points and their corresponding labels. For each data point, it computes the predicted output using the current weights and compares it to the actual label.  ● Weight Update: If the predicted output matches the actual label, the weights remain  unchanged. However, if the prediction is incorrect, the algorithm adjusts the weights to make the predicted output more accurate. This adjustment involves adding or subtracting a certain value from each weight, proportional to the error made in the prediction.  ● Convergence: The algorithm repeats the training loop until it correctly classifies all the  input data points or reaches a predetermined number of iterations. If the input data can be separated into classes using a straight line (linearly separable), the Perceptron is guaranteed to converge and find a dividing line that distinguishes the two classes.  The fundamental concept of the multilayer perceptron involves adding hidden layers between the input and output layers. Within these hidden layers, each artificial neuron calculates a weighted sum of its inputs, applies an activation function to the sum, and transmits the outcome to the subsequent layer. This arrangement allows the MLP to effectively capture and represent complex nonlinear relationships present in the data.  The backpropagation algorithm is a vital component in training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, allowing it to learn from errors and adapt its connection weights to enhance predictions.  During training, the algorithm follows these steps: The MLP receives input data, and activations are calculated in a layered fashion, starting from the input layer and progressing through the hidden layers to the output layer. Neuron activations are determined by weighted sums of inputs and activation functions.  Comparing the predicted output to the true output yields an error, which is then propagated backward through the network. Each neuron in the output layer receives an error contribution based on its impact on the overall error.  Using this error information, the algorithm adjusts the connection weights. It computes the gradient of the error with respect to the weights and updates them in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the error.  The error is also propagated backward through the hidden layers, assigning error contributions to neurons based on their connections and subsequent layer errors.  This iterative process of forward propagation, error calculation, weight adjustment, and backpropagation occurs for multiple training examples. Gradually, the weights adapt to minimize the error, thereby improving the model's predictive accuracy.  By continuously adjusting the weights based on error information, the backpropagation algorithm enables the MLP to learn intricate relationships in the data. It plays a critical role in training the MLP and enhancing its predictive capabilities.
