 Components of a neural network:    A typical neural network has an input layer;      It has one or many hidden layers; It has combiners (sum functions); It has nonlinear activation functions; It has an output layer.  Perceptron: Perceptron is a linear classifier (binary) and is a single layer neural network.  Multilayer perceptron:    A feedforward neural network is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) : In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes.    A multi-layer feed-forward Neural Network (NN): The model comprises multiple layers of  logistic regression like models rather than multiple perceptron.  Backpropagation Algorithm: It is a method for calculating the gradients of the network's weights with respect to a loss function, which allows for the adjustment of the weights during the training process.  Deep learning: A deep learning model is designed to continually analyze data with a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions.  Autoencoder: An Autoencoder is a neural network which can handle many hidden layers in its structure.
