The main points covered in this topic are all about motivation and inspiration, neural system basics, perceptron algorithm, Motivation for multilayer perceptron, multilayer perceptron, backpropagation algorithm and introduction to deep learning, convolutional neural networks, Applications of CNN, autoencoder. Then we started to implement perceptron and MLP in python and deep learning with python.
