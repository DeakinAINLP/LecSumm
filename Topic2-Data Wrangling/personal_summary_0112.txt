Topic 10 summary  The topic for this topic is Non-linear Models (neural networks and deep learning)  Neural system basics: With the brain in mind, let’s introduce the major players in a neural network system:    a typical neural network (machine) has an input layer;      it has one or many hidden layers; it has combiners (sum functions); it has nonlinear activation functions; it has an output layer.  Complexity: neural networks are compatible with high dimensional inputs and multi-label classiﬁcation making them bigger and complex.  Perceptron algorithm: It is a linear classiﬁer (binary) and is a single layer neural network. A multi-layer perceptron is called a neural network.  Feedforward neural networks: A feedforward neural network is an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) where connections between units do not form a cycle. In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes.    A multi-layer feed-forward Neural Network (NN) is also known as a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP).  Backpropagation algorithm: Backpropagation computes the gradient in weight space of a feedforward neural network, with respect to a loss function.  Deep learning: It is designed to continually analyze data with a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions.  Convolutional Neural Networks: It is a network architecture for deep learning that learns directly from data.  o  CNN are made of 3 basic concepts:   Sparse interactions   Parameter sharing   Translation invariance  LeNet5: A convolutional neural network that uses a sequence of 3 layers: convolution, pooling, non- linearity.  Autoencoder: It is a neural network which can handle many hidden layers in its structure. It learns a representation for a dataset to reduce dimensions.
