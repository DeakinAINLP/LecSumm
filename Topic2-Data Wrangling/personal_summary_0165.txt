Topic 10  Key Learning Points  Neural networks  Perceptron algorithm Perceptron is a binary classifier and is a single layer neural network. A multi-layer perceptron is called a neural network.  Feedforward neural networks A feedforward neural network is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) where connections between units do not form a cycle. In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes and to the output nodes.  A multi-layer feed-forward Neural Network (NN) is also known as a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP).  The basic concept of training MLPs is a stochastic gradient-descent rule. Based on the gradient-descent rule..  Convolutional Neural Networks  The architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is modelled after the mammalian visual cortex, the part of the brain where visual input is processed.  Autoencoder An Autoencoder is a neural network which can handle many hidden layers in its structure.  The aim of an Autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction.  This type of neural network is trained to attempt to copy its input to its output. Internally, it has a hidden layer that describes a code used to represent the input.    Recently, the Autoencoder concept has become more widely used for learning generative models of data.
