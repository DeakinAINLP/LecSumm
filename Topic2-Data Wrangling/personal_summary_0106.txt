Neural Network:  Topic – 10  Neural Network is very simple to our human brain which has multiple layers , neural networks consists of multiple layer where in each layer performs a specific task, when input passes through these layers it transforms and brings us a solution which is closer to solution.  Perceptron:  Perceptron is simple neural network used for binary classification, this has one layer with single node and works by assigning weights to the independent variables and produces output with a variable which acts as bias term . Perceptron is mostly used to classify data into two groups.  Multi-layer Feed forward NN:  Comparing Perceptron which works on classifying into two groups by separating the data based creating hyperplane among the datapoints. For training problems with complex data or where data can’t be represented as linear expression, We use Multi-layer Feed Neural Network which interlinked with multiple layer where the data is transformed at each layer with the use of sigmoid function and once the data is transformed it is pushed forward is not sent backwards.
