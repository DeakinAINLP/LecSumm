Within this module, it introduces us towards the complex concepts of Neural networks, perceptron and multilayer perceptronâ€™s, and Deep learning. This module begins through explaining upon on the concepts of Artificial Neural Networks, its history, and how it works through mimicking neurons in our brains, while also listing out the neural system basics. The module then explains the Perceptron algorithm, and the motivation of multilayer perceptron. It also explains what Feedforward neural networks are and the backpropagation algorithm. Finally, the module ends through introducing the concept of deep learning, explaining it, providing examples, and lists the common deep learning architectures such as Convolutional networks, Autoencoders etc.  Within this module, I believe that I am able to gain an understanding of artificial neural networks, and how it works through the mimicking of our brains. I am also able to understand upon the concepts of multilayer perceptron, the backpropagation algorithm and the concepts of Deep learning. Through this, I am able to complete the pass tasks provided within this unit, through implementing the MLP algorithm, and can report its performance metrics based on how well it is able to identify faces.
