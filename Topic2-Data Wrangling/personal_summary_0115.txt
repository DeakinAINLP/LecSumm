SVM can construct nonlinear functions but use fixed feature transformations which depends on the  kernel function.  Neural Networks allow the feature transformations to be learnt from data.  A neural network system consists of the following :  an input layer  one or more hidden layers  combiners  nonlinear activation functions  output layer  Perceptron : Its a simple neural network used for binary classification. It has only one layer with a single node.  Feedforward neural networks  It is an Artificial Neural Network where connections between units do not form a cycle. On this network, the information only moves forward, from the input nodes through the hidden nodes to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.  A multi-layer feed-forward Neural Network is also known as Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP).  Deep learning Deep learning methods are advanced neural networks. Common deep learning architectures are as  follows :  Convolutional Networks Auto encoders Deep Belief Networks Boltzmann Machines  Restricted Boltzmann Machines Deep Boltzmann Machines Deep Neural Networks  Convolutional Neural Networks : These are made of three basic concepts :  Sparse interactions : Sparse weights within a small kernel instead of the whole input. Parameter sharing : A kernel uses the same set of weights while applying to different locations  https://www.evernote.com/client/web?login=true#?an=true&fs=true&n=7b6872b8-4b99-4000-1c29-a79088ed6bfa&  1/3  6/2/23, 2:49 PM  Topic 10 - Nonlinear models (Neural networks and deep learning) - Evernote  Translation invariance : Invariance means that you can recognise an object as an object, even when  the its appearance varies in some way.  LeNe5  This was the very first CNN. It has the following features :  a convolutional neural network that uses a sequence of 3 layers : convolution, pooling and non-  linearity.  uses convolution to extract spatial features  subsamples using spatial average of maps  nonlinearity in the form of tanh and sigmoids  basically an MLP as final classifier  uses a sparse connection matrix between layers to avoid large computational cost  Autoencoder  An auto-encoder is a neural network which can handle many hidden layers in its structure. Its aim is to  learn a representation for a set of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction. It learns to  compress data from the input layer into a short code, and then uncompress that code into something that closely matches the original data. It forces the auto-encoder to engage in dimensionality reduction.  https://www.evernote.com/client/web?login=true#?an=true&fs=true&n=7b6872b8-4b99-4000-1c29-a79088ed6bfa&  2/3  6/2/23, 2:49 PM  Topic 10 - Nonlinear models (Neural networks and deep learning) - Evernote  https://www.evernote.com/client/web?login=true#?an=true&fs=true&n=7b6872b8-4b99-4000-1c29-a79088ed6bfa&  3/3
