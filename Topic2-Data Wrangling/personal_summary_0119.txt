 Following previous topic, the focus was to expand knowledge about concepts including neural networks, perceptron, multilayer perceptron, and deep learning  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are inspired by the interconnected networks of neurons in the human brain, and their development aims to mimic the brain's highly-parallel architecture.  Linear models, while useful in many cases, may not be sufficient when dealing with highly nonlinear functions or decision boundaries. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) offer a solution by using fixed feature transformations determined by kernel functions. However, ANNs provide a more flexible approach by allowing feature transformations to be learned directly from the data, eliminating the need for predetermined kernels.  The major players in a neural network system are described as follows:    An input layer: Responsible for taking input features.   Hidden layers: One or multiple layers that process the input data.   Combiners: Sum functions that combine the inputs in the hidden layers.   Nonlinear activation functions: Functions applied to the combined inputs to introduce  nonlinearity.    An output layer: Produces the final output of the neural network.  Perceptron algorithm  Two-class (binary) classification machine learning algorithm. It is a type of neural network model, perhaps the simplest type of neural network model. It consists of a single node or neuron that takes a row of data as input and predicts a class label.  Multilayer perceptron(MLP)  The use of non-linear activation functions, such as the sigmoid function, allows MLPs to combine inputs in more complex ways and model richer functions.  Feedforward neural networks is where information flows only in one direction from input nodes through hidden nodes to output nodes.  Backpropagation algorithm  Also known as backward propagation of errors, an algorithm that is designed to test for errors working back from output nodes to input nodes. It is an important mathematical tool for improving the accuracy of predictions in data mining and machine learning.  Deep learning  Deep learning is a powerful approach that utilizes layered algorithms to analyze data and draw conclusions, similar to how humans process information. It has achieved success in various real- world tasks, such as image recognition and handwritten digit recognition. Several common architectures of deep learning include Convolutional Networks, Autoencoders, Deep Belief Networks, Boltzmann Machines, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Deep Boltzmann Machines, and Deep Neural Networks. Among these, Convolutional Networks (CNN) are particularly important.    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  Inspired by the brain's visual cortex and process images in layers. They use sparse interactions, parameter sharing, and translation invariance to extract features. The LeNet5 architecture, employs convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers for feature extraction and classification. LeNet5 has influenced subsequent architectures in deep learning.  Autoencoders  neural networks that compress input data into a compact representation and then reconstruct it. They aim to minimize the reconstruction error during training. The hidden layer serves as the encoded version of the input, providing a meaningful representation.
