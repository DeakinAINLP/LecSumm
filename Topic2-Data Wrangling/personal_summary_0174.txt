This  topic We  looked  into  decision  trees  and  random  forests  last  topic.  Additionally,  we improved our Python programming abilities. The final Python of the course and the last piece of code you need for the exam is the random forest algorithm. This topic, we delve into a few fascinating  linked  ideas: Multilayer  perceptron’s  and  neural  networks  perceptron’s robust learning. Neural networks are necessary in certain machine learning problems where linear models or fixed feature transformations are insufficient. Neural networks offer the ability to learn feature transformations from the data itself, making them more flexible and adaptable. While there are different approaches to studying neural networks, in this course, we focus on designing neural networks as effective learning machines rather than attempting to model the brain directly. The brain, with its billions of neurons, performs various tasks and processes stimuli to produce appropriate outputs. Neural networks mimic the parallel architecture and interconnectedness  of  neurons  in  the  brain,  allowing  them  to  handle  complex,  nonlinear problems effectively. Perceptron algorithm it is a linear classifier (binary) and is a single layer neural network. A multi-layer perceptron is called a neural network.  The  motivation  for  using  a  multilayer  perceptron  (MLP)  is  to  capture  complex  decision boundaries  and  nonlinear  relationships  within  the  data,  which  cannot  be  achieved  with  a single line or a simple linear classifier. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) replaces the simple sign function employed in a perceptron with a more sophisticated activation function, such as  the  sigmoid  function,  to  represent  complex,  non-linear  decision  surfaces.  The  sigmoid function produces values in the range of 0 and 1, giving functions a richer modelling capability. Information can only flow in one direction in feedforward neural networks, including MLPs, because the connections between the units are not designed to form cycles. Input, hidden, and output layers are among the layers that make up MLPs, and there may be several hidden layers. The input layer only relays the input vector, and the connections between the layers are weighted. MLPs can be partially connected and have demonstrated to be effective models in a variety of applications, such as image processing and self-driving cars.  The backpropagation algorithm is used to train multilayer perceptron’s. It involves iteratively updating  the  weights  of  the  network  based  on  the  gradient  of  the  error  function.  The algorithm consists of a forward pass to calculate the network's output, an error calculation step, a backward pass to propagate the error back through the network, and a weight update step. This process is repeated until a stopping criteria is met. We also had hands on experience on these topic in python .  Machine learning's deep learning subfield analyses data and makes predictions using layered algorithms.  It  attempts  to  imitate  human-like  reasoning  and  draws  inspiration  from  the anatomy  of  the  human  brain.  Convolutional  networks,  autoencoders,  and  deep  neural networks are examples of deep learning models that have proved successful in a variety of applications  such  handwritten  digit  recognition  and  picture  recognition.  The  fundamental ideas of convolutional networks (CNN), a key architecture in deep learning, will be the subject of the next section.  The  neural  network  topologies  known  as  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  were influenced  by  the  visual  cortex  of  the  brain.  They  carry  out  hierarchical  image  processing,       identifying intricate patterns and identifying features. To lower the number of parameters and  increase  efficiency,  CNNs  make  use  of  sparse  interactions,  parameter  sharing,  and translation  invariance.  Yann  LeCun  popularised  LeNet5,  a  CNN  design  with  convolution, pooling, non-linearity, and fully-connected layers. It has influenced the creation of numerous subsequent CNN models.  Datasets like CIFAR 10, which comprises 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, have been successfully used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Each network layer in a CNN serves as a detection filter for particular data properties or patterns. Early layers pick up on big, obvious elements, whereas deeper layers pick up on more intricate patterns. To effectively  train  these  deep  networks,  you  need  a  sizable  dataset.  Larger  models,  novel training methods, the accessibility of expansive datasets like ImageNet, and the utilisation of quick  graphics  processing  units  (GPUs)  for  effective  computation  are  all  factors  that  have contributed  to  deep  learning's  success.  Due  to  these  elements,  deep  learning  is  now practically usable after overcoming initial difficulties.  Autoencoder A  neural  network  that  can  manage  numerous  hidden  layers  is  called  an autoencoder. An autoencoder's goal is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, usually with the intention of reducing dimensionality. This specific kind of neural network is taught to try to replicate its input in its output. It has a layer Z concealed underneath that explains  the  code  that  is  utilised  to  represent  the  input.  The  autoencoder  idea  has  been utilised for learning generative data models more frequently recently.
