By this topic all content for machine learning have been covered, and this topic we dive into the basics of deep learning. Starting with the basic concepts like its derivation from the functioning of the human mind and other terminology like perceptron, neural networks and convolutional neural networks along with their python implementations using datasets from SKLearn.  Reading List This module starts with an introduction in 10.1 and 10.2 and from 10.3 to 10.5 we cover basics like neural  system,  working  of  perceptron  algorithm  and  how  it  resulted  in  formation  of  multi-layer perceptron in 10.6.  10.7 covers backpropagation algorithm and then in 10.8 we cover python implementation of all the topics covered so far. By now all basic concepts have been covered and we dive on to deep learning from 10.9 and the concept of CNN in 10.10 which also covers its types along with its applications in 10.11.  10.12 covers autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and we finish off this module in 10.13 with python implementation of deep learning along some additional content and resources in 10.14.
