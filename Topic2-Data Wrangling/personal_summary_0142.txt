In this code, I am exploring the impact of different activation functions and solvers on the performance of a deep learning model. I have defined the activation functions and solvers variables to include the different options I want to investigate. I then iterate over all possible combinations of activation functions and solvers, creating a new MLP classifier for each combination and evaluating its performance using the classification report.  By comparing the performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for each combination, I can observe the influence of different activation functions and solvers on the model's performance. This analysis provides insights into how my choices of activation functions and solvers affect the model's performance on the given dataset.  Based on the outcomes I obtained, I found that the best performance is achieved when using the activation function "tanh" with the solver "adam." This combination resulted in an accuracy of 0.86 and an F1-score of 0.86, indicating the highest overall performance on the dataset.  These findings highlight the impact of activation function and solver selection on the model's performance. Specifically, using the "tanh" activation function with the "adam" solver improved the model's performance compared to other combinations, such as using the "relu" activation function or the "sgd" solver.  It is important to note that these findings are specific to the given dataset and may vary for different datasets or problem domains. Therefore, it is always recommended to experiment with different activation functions and solvers to find the optimal configuration for a specific task.  Comparing the initial results before hyperparameter tuning, which had an accuracy of 0.58 and an F1-score of 0.51, with the results after tuning, which achieved an accuracy of 0.86 and an F1-score of 0.86, demonstrates a significant improvement in the model's performance. The initial results indicated poor classification performance, but after tuning the hyperparameters, the model was able to learn and generalize better, resulting in higher accuracy and F1-score.  This comparison underscores the importance of hyperparameter tuning in enhancing the performance of a deep learning model. By optimizing the hyperparameters, I was able to achieve substantial improvements, highlighting the impact of parameter selection on the model's effectiveness.  It is worth emphasizing that hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in machine learning and can often lead to significant enhancements in model performance. This process involves systematically exploring different hyperparameter combinations to find the optimal configuration for a given dataset and problem.
