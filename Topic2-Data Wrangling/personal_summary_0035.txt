The key points covered in topic ten are:  1.  Neural network concepts: input layer, hidden layer, and output layer, activation, and sum  functions  2.  Advantage of neural network: allow the feature transformations to be learnt from data. 3.  Forward and backpropagation for training 4.  Perceptron algorithm involving weights and biases for the features, the activation function  and sum.  5.  Multi-layer perceptron to handle non-linear data and use of gradient descent to optimize  the model.  6.  Python packages for neural networks such as MLPClassifier and the tensorflow library 7.  Introduction to Deep Learning and CNN
