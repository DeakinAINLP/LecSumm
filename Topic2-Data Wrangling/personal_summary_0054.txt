 During topic ten of the course, we focused on neural network, which mainly on ANN. The  lecture  covered  the  importance  of  understanding  connection  between  human brain  and  neural  networks. into  multilayer  perceptron,  and backpropagation  algorithm.  We  also  learned  about  the  sci-kit  processes  in  Python, which can be used to implement neural networks on train data and evaluation on test data and use of different activation functions and solvers to get best performance. Overall, the lecture provided a deep understanding of ANN.
