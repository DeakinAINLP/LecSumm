SIT720 Task 10.1P  Learning summary report  This topic provided a high-level coverage of neural networks and deep learning. We started by exploring the motivation and the approach behind neural networks.  We looked at the basic architecture of the NN system and its complexity.  We then explored the perceptron algorithm in depth, discussed the motivation for using multilayer perceptron and had a detailed coverage on how they work.  We also explored the backpropagation algorithm and how to implement MLP in Python.  We followed with an introduction to deep learning and some of the deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, and autoencoders. We explored Convolutional Neural Networks, including LeNe5 and discussed their application in real world scenarios.  Theory concluded with an overview of the autoencoder architecture.  The last part of the topic focused on the use of the Python programming language and how it can be used in order to create deep learning models using the TensorFlow library and provided further resources for further study of Deep Learning.
