Motivation and inspiration The motivation and inspiration behind the development of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is the biological neural systems found in the brain. ANNs are necessary in machine learning problems where linear models are insufficient due to highly nonlinear functions or decision boundaries. While support vector machines can handle nonlinear functions, they rely on fixed feature transformations determined by kernel functions. Neural Networks, on the other hand, allow for the learning of feature transformations from the data itself. In the field of machine learning, there are two groups of ANN researchers. One group uses ANNs to study and model the brain, while the other group designs ANNs inspired by the brain as effective learning machines, without necessarily aiming to create an accurate model of the brain. Neural system basics A neural network system consists of several components: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, combiners (sum functions), nonlinear activation functions, and an output layer. The input layer receives input features, and the output layer produces the desired outputs. Hidden layers are responsible for processing and transforming the input data. The complexity of a neural network can vary, with different numbers of hidden layers and dimensions for input and output layers. Neural networks can handle high-dimensional inputs and are suitable for multi-label classification. However, when using more complex neural networks, there is a risk of overfitting if there is insufficient training data available. Perceptron algorithm The Perceptron algorithm is a linear classifier and a type of single-layer neural network used for binary classification. It has one layer with a single node. The algorithm aims to find a hyperplane that separates two linearly separable sets of data. The Perceptron takes input features with corresponding weights and a bias term. It calculates a linear combination of the inputs and weights, and the output is determined based on whether the sum is greater than or equal to zero. The algorithm iteratively updates the weights until convergence. The goal is to find the weight vector that correctly classifies the training data. The algorithm updates the weights based on the learning rate and the error between the desired output and the actual output. It repeats this process for each data point until convergence. Motivation for multilayer perceptron The motivation for developing a multilayer perceptron (MLP) stems from the limitations of a single-layer perceptron in handling nonlinear problems. While linearly separable problems like the AND and OR logical gates can be solved using a single line, the XOR problem cannot be linearly separated with a single line. The XOR problem serves as an example of a nonlinear problem where data points with different class labels cannot be separated by a single line. This motivated the development of the MLP, which includes a layer in the middle to handle such cases. The MLP, with its ability to incorporate hidden layers, was later proven to be capable of representing and solving the XOR problem. Multilayer perceptron The multilayer perceptron (MLP) is introduced as a solution to represent complex, non-linear decision surfaces. It overcomes the limitations of a single-layer perceptron by incorporating a layer in the middle, allowing for more complex combinations of inputs through the use of non-linear activation functions. Non-linear activation functions, such as the logistic (sigmoid) function, provide a continuous and meaningful transformation of inputs in a multi-layer network. This enables the MLP to model more complex functions. A feedforward neural network, which includes the MLP, is an artificial neural network where information flows only in one direction, from the input nodes through the hidden nodes (if any) to the output nodes. It does not contain cycles or loops. The MLP consists of layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. It utilizes weights for the connections between layers, specifically the input to hidden weights and the hidden to output weights. The input layer relays the input vector, and the hidden layers perform computations to produce outputs. The MLP can have multiple hidden layers and does not need to be fully connected. To train the MLP, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the error between the predicted and desired outputs. Gradient-based optimization methods, such as gradient descent, are used to update the network weights iteratively. The backpropagation algorithm, based on gradient descent, is commonly used to train MLPs by propagating the error backward through the network and adjusting the weights accordingly. By incorporating the principles of gradient-based optimization, MLPs can effectively learn and represent complex functions, making them a powerful tool in various applications, including image processing and self-driving cars. Introduction to Deep Learning A deep learning model is designed to continually analyze data with a logic structure like how a human would draw conclusions. To achieve this, deep learning uses a layered structure of algorithms like ANNs. Deep learning methods are advanced neural networks. They have been successful in learning many real world tasks (e.g. handwritten digit recognition, image recognition). Some of the common Deep learning architectures are:   Convolutional Networks   Autoencoders   Deep Belief Networks   Boltzmann Machines   Restricted Boltzmann Machines   Deep Boltzmann Machines   Deep Neural Networks Convolutional Neural Networks The architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs or ConvNets) is inspired by the mammalian visual cortex, which processes visual input in layers of increasing complexity. CNNs aim to mimic this process by utilizing sparse interactions, parameter sharing, and translation invariance. CNNs are characterized by their ability to focus on specific regions of an image and work with local regions, resulting in sparsity and locality. They employ convolutional layers that use smaller kernels to reduce the number of parameters and extract features from the input. Parameter sharing allows the same set of weights to be applied to different locations, enabling the network to learn similar features across the image. Translation invariance ensures that objects can be recognized regardless of variations in appearance or relative positions. Application of CNN Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied to various real-world examples, including the CIFAR 10 dataset, which consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. In CNNs, each layer acts as a detection filter for specific features or patterns in the data. The initial layers detect large and easily recognizable features, while deeper layers capture more complex patterns. The concept of feature detection is evident across different layers of a CNN, where specific filters are designed to identify different parts of patterns or textures. It is crucial to have a large dataset for training deep networks to obtain meaningful results. Deep learning has been propelled by several factors, including the ability to model larger networks using techniques like dropout, maxout, maxnorm, and ReLU. Additionally, the availability of large datasets such as ImageNet, which comprises 1.2 million training samples across 1,000 categories, has been instrumental. The use of fast graphical processing units (GPUs) capable of high-speed operations has also contributed to the practical usefulness of deep learning. These advancements have addressed challenges and significantly boosted the field of deep learning. Autoencoder An autoencoder is a neural network that can handle multiple hidden layers in its structure. Its main objective is to learn a compressed representation (encoding) of input data for dimensionality reduction. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct its input as closely as possible at the output layer, using a hidden layer that represents a compact code for the input. The autoencoder learns to compress the input data into a short code and then reconstructs that code into something similar to the original data. This process encourages dimensionality reduction and noise filtering. The loss function of the autoencoder measures the difference between the input and output, aiming to minimize the reconstruction error. Autoencoders serve as a method of feature learning, where the hidden layers capture meaningful representations of the input data. Linear autoencoders with a single hidden layer can perform principal component analysis (PCA), but the non-linearity introduced in deeper utoencoders makes them more powerful.
