Nonlinear models are machine learning models that can capture complex, non- linear relationships between input features and target variables. Unlike linear models that assume a linear relationship, nonlinear models can model intricate patterns and interactions in the data. Here are some commonly used nonlinear models:  1.  Decision Trees: Decision trees recursively split the data based on different feature thresholds,  creating a tree-like structure. They can capture non-linear decision boundaries and interactions between features.  2.  Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees. Each tree is trained on a different subset of the data and features. The ensemble approach helps capture non-linear relationships and improve model performance.  3.  Gradient Boosting: Gradient Boosting is another ensemble method that combines weak learners (typically decision trees) in a sequential manner. Each subsequent model focuses on correcting the mistakes made by the previous models, capturing non-linear patterns effectively.  4.  Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVMs can use kernel functions to map the input features into a higher-dimensional space where the data becomes linearly separable. This allows SVMs to capture non-linear relationships by finding optimal hyperplanes in the transformed space.  5.  Neural Networks: Neural networks are powerful models composed of interconnected layers of artificial neurons. They can capture highly complex and non-linear relationships between features. Deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers are particularly effective in modeling non-linear patterns.  6.  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is a non-parametric model that classifies data points based on their nearest neighbors. It can capture non-linear decision boundaries and is particularly useful in cases where the underlying relationships are complex and hard to define analytically.  These are just a few examples of nonlinear models commonly used in machine learning. The choice of a particular nonlinear model depends on the specific problem, the complexity of the data, and the interpretability requirements. It is important to select a model that best suits the characteristics of the data and the objectives of the problem at hand.
