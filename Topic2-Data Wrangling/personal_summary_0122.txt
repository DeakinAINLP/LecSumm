Neural Systems Basics:  Neural systems are networks of interconnected nerve cells that enable communication and information processing in the brain and nervous system. They consist of neurons, which transmit electrical signals called action potentials, and synapses, which allow for communication between neurons. These systems play a crucial role in coordinating sensory perception, motor control, and cognitive functions. Overall, neural systems form the foundation for complex behaviours and the functioning of the nervous system.  Perceptron Algorithm:  The perceptron algorithm is a linear binary classification algorithm. It takes an input vector and assigns weights to each feature. By summing the weighted features and applying a threshold, it makes a prediction of either class 1 or class 0. It updates the weights based on prediction errors, iteratively improving the classification performance.  Multilayer Perceptron (MPL):  The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. The formulation of the MLP involves the following steps:    Input Layer: The input layer receives the input data, which is typically represented as a vector.    Hidden Layers: The MLP can have one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers. Each hidden layer consists of multiple neurons (also known as units) that perform computations on the input data.    Activation Function: Each neuron in the MLP applies an activation function to the  weighted sum of its inputs and biases. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU.    Output Layer: The final layer of the MLP is the output layer, which produces the  predicted output based on the computations performed in the previous layers. The activation function used in the output layer depends on the task, such as sigmoid for binary classification or softmax for multi-class classification.    Training: The MLP is trained using a process called backpropagation, where the errors between the predicted output and the desired output are propagated backwards through the network. This allows the weights and biases of the neurons to be adjusted iteratively using optimization algorithms like gradient descent.  Backpropagation Algorithm:  The backpropagation algorithm is used to train neural networks with multiple layers. It involves the following steps:    Forward Pass: The input data is propagated forward through the network, calculating  the output of each neuron.    Error Calculation: The difference between the predicted output and the desired  output is calculated, forming the error.    Backward Pass: The error is propagated backward through the network, computing  the gradients of the weights and biases of each neuron.    Weight Update: The weights and biases are updated using the gradients and an  optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, to minimize the error and improve the network's performance. This process is repeated iteratively until convergence.  Introduction to deep learning:  Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks with multiple layers. It leverages deep architectures to learn complex patterns and representations from large amounts of data. Deep learning has been successful in various tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. It is characterized by its ability to automatically extract features and hierarchically process information, leading to state-of-the-art performance in many domains.  Some of the common Deep learning architectures are:    Convolutional Networks   Autoencoders   Deep Belief Networks   Boltzmann Machines   Restricted Boltzmann Machines   Deep Boltzmann Machines   Deep Neural Networks  Convolutional Neural Networks:  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for analysing visual data such as images. They utilize convolutional layers that perform local feature extraction by convolving filters across the input image. Pooling layers are used to downsample and reduce spatial dimensions. The extracted features are then fed into fully connected layers for classification or regression tasks. CNNs have revolutionized computer vision tasks, achieving remarkable performance in image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.     CNNs are made of three basic concepts:  Sparse interactions: Sparse weights within a smaller kernel Instead of the whole input. This helps reduce the number of parameters. The term kernel in CNN generally refers to an operator applied to the entirety of the image such that it transforms the information encoded in the pixels (see the figure above).  Parameter sharing: A kernel uses the same set of weights while applying to different locations (sliding windows).  Translation invariance: Invariance means that you can recognize an object as an object, even when its appearance varies in some way. This is generally a good thing, because it allows abstraction of an objectâ€™s identity or category from the specifics of the visual input.  Applications of CNN:  1.  Image Classification: CNNs excel at image classification tasks, accurately classifying  objects within images, enabling applications like autonomous driving, medical image analysis, and visual search.  2.  Object Detection: CNN-based object detection models can locate and classify multiple objects within an image, enabling applications such as surveillance, autonomous robotics, and facial recognition.  3.  Image Segmentation: CNNs can perform pixel-level segmentation, separating objects from the background, and enabling applications like medical imaging, autonomous navigation, and virtual reality.  4.  Natural Language Processing: CNNs have been used for text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation tasks, leveraging their ability to process sequential data, such as text or speech.  Autoencoders:  Autoencoders are neural network architectures used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. They consist of an encoder network that compresses input data into a latent representation, and a decoder network that reconstructs the original input from the latent space. Autoencoders are commonly used for tasks like data denoising, anomaly detection, and feature learning.  We have also learnt deep learning with python.
