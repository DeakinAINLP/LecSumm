Inspiration for neural networks:  Our brain has networks of inter-connected neurons and a highly-parallel architecture. Development of Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs) is motivated by biological neural systems.  The brain takes physical or mental stimuli as input, processes it and, if necessary, produces an output. For example, perhaps you see a dog. Your brain processes that visual and auditory input and, depending on your past experiences, produces a desire to pat the dog or run away etc.  Neural system basics:  With the brain in mind, let’s introduce the major players in a neural network system:    a typical neural network (machine) has an input layer;      it has one or many hidden layers; it has combiners (sum functions); it has nonlinear activation functions; it has an output layer.  A neural network model consists of several key components:  1. Input Layer: The input layer receives the initial data or features to be processed by the network. Each input corresponds to a neuron in the input layer.  2. Hidden Layers: Hidden layers are intermediate layers between the input and output layers. They transform the input data through a series of weighted computations and activation functions. Deep neural networks have multiple hidden layers.  3. Neurons: Neurons, also known as nodes or units, are the fundamental processing units in a neural network. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer, applies a weighted sum of inputs, and passes the result through an activation function to produce an output.  4. Weights and Biases: Weights and biases are parameters that determine the strength of connections between neurons. Each connection has an associated weight that adjusts the influence of one neuron's output on another neuron's input. Biases provide an additional learnable constant term in each neuron.  5. Activation Function: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network. Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU, tanh, and softmax. They determine the output of a neuron based on its weighted sum of inputs.  6. Output Layer: The output layer produces the final predictions or outputs of the neural network. The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the specific task. For example, in classification tasks, each neuron in the output layer may correspond to a class label.  7. Loss Function: The loss function quantifies the difference between the predicted outputs and the true labels or targets. It measures the network's performance during training and guides the optimization process.  8. Optimization Algorithm: The optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, is used to update the weights and biases of the neural network based on the gradients of the loss function with respect to these parameters. This process iteratively improves the network's performance.  These are the basic components of a neural network model. Neural networks can vary in architecture, including different types of layers, activation functions, and optimization algorithms, to address various tasks and data types.  Perceptron algorithm  The perceptron algorithm is a basic binary classification algorithm for neural networks. It starts by initializing the weights and biases to random values. Then, it iteratively trains the model on the training data. For each input, the model computes the weighted sum of the inputs and applies an activation function. If the predicted output matches the true label, no adjustment is made. However, if there is a misclassification, the weights and biases are updated based on the error, pushing the decision boundary closer to the correct classification. This process continues until the model converges or a predefined stopping criterion is met.  Multi-Layer Perceptron  A perceptron is quite weak in what it can represent. For complex, non-linear decision surfaces, we need a multi-layer network.  A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of neural network architecture that consists of multiple layers of interconnected perceptrons or artificial neurons. It has an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The hidden layers apply non-linear activation functions to transform the input data, enabling the model to learn complex patterns and relationships. The weights and biases of the MLP are adjusted through backpropagation, where the error between the predicted output and the true output is propagated backward through the network, and gradient descent is used to update the parameters. MLPs are capable of solving a wide range of tasks, including classification, regression, and pattern recognition.  Feedforward neural networks:  A feedforward neural network is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) where connections between units do not form a cycle. In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.  A multi-layer feed-forward Neural Network (NN) is also known as a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). The term MLP is really an accurate name because the model comprises multiple layers of logistic regression like models (with continuous non-linearities) rather than multiple perceptrons (with discontinuous non-linearities).  Notes on MLP  The multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of feedforward neural network that consists of multiple layers of artificial neurons or perceptrons. Each neuron in the MLP receives inputs, applies weights to those inputs, computes a weighted sum, and passes it through an activation function to produce an output.  Let's denote the number of layers in the MLP as L, with the input layer being layer 0 and the output layer being layer L. The hidden layers are denoted as layer 1 to L-1.  For each neuron j in layer l (excluding the input layer), the computation can be expressed as follows:  z_j^l = Σ(w_ij^l * a_i^(l-1)) + b_j^l  Here, z_j^l represents the weighted sum of inputs to neuron j in layer l, w_ij^l represents the weight connecting neuron i in layer l-1 to neuron j in layer l, a_i^(l-1) is the output of neuron i in layer l-1, and b_j^l is the bias term associated with neuron j in layer l.  Once the weighted sum is computed, it is passed through an activation function to produce the output of neuron j in layer l:  a_j^l = f(z_j^l)  The activation function f introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships.  The outputs of the neurons in the output layer represent the final predictions or outputs of the MLP.  During training, the weights and biases of the MLP are updated iteratively using backpropagation and an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent. The goal is to minimize a predefined loss function that quantifies the difference between the predicted outputs and the true outputs.  In summary, the MLP formulation involves computing the weighted sums and applying activation functions in each layer to transform the inputs and produce the final predictions. The weights and biases are adjusted through training to improve the network's performance on the given task.  Gradient-based optimization is a class of optimization algorithms used to iteratively adjust the parameters of a model in order to minimize a loss function. It relies on computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters, which indicate the direction of steepest ascent or descent. Popular gradient-based optimization algorithms include gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and variants such as Adam and RMSprop. These algorithms update the parameters in small steps proportional to the negative gradient, allowing the model to converge towards a minimum of the loss function and improve its performance during training.
