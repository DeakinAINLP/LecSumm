 This is the last topic of Unit SIT720 Machine Learning, and this topic I have learned about ANN, CNN and Deep learning Machine learning model, why we need it, how it works and how to implement in Python programming language.  The idea came from the human brain, the neurons, in our brain, there are billions of neurons which form a network, this network has been storing information since the human evolution, it knows what to do and what not to from the past mistakes and achievements. The idea behind Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN) is directly inspired by the human brain.  In simple words, we are talking about the Machine learning model, where we allows the mistakes to be made, and adapt the model every iteration and create a gets smarter and smarter until there is nothing more learn to left.  Typically Neural System has input layer, which takes the input values, and some hidden layers which adjust every iterations and output layer which is the prediction.  Real magic happens in the hidden layers, and the way they are constructed. Yes, you got it right, there is no magic here, itâ€™s pure mathematics. Every hidden layers have fixed number of neurons and every neurons has some weights and biased associated with it, which either gets activated or not depending on the input data, and the values of weights and biases assigned during the training face, As soon the new input data gets into these neurons, either they gets activated or not, and    the values are passed on the next layers, resulting in only one activation in the output layer, which is the prediction value.  This brought us to Deep learning, a machine learning method that is capable of solving problems just like humans, it is trained on large data and evolved continuously over time, that is capable of playing games, recognizing images and understanding natural speech.  Later, I learned how to create neural networks in Python programming language.
