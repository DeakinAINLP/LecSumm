It consists of an input, hidden and output layer.   Artificial neural networks is based on our own biological neural systems  They are either used to study the brain or based on the brainâ€™s design   There can be multiple hidden layers  A perceptron is a single layer neural network  Neural networks can have higher dimensionality  A multi-layer perceptron is a neural network  Back propagation is used to train neural networks  Deep learning is advanced neural networks   CNN is a visual neural network and modelled after the visual cortex  Auto encoders is used for dimensionality reduction  Some common deep learning structures are CNN and Auto-encoders.
