This topic's focus was on machine learning, particularly neural networks and deep learning. We started with the basics of neural systems, including their structure and functioning. The perceptron algorithm was introduced, which is a fundamental building block of neural networks. The motivation for using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) was explained. MLPs are capable of learning complex patterns and are widely used in various applications. The concept of the multilayer perceptron was covered, highlighting its architecture with multiple layers of interconnected neurons. The backpropagation algorithm was discussed as a method for training MLPs by adjusting the weights to minimize error. Python programming was introduced as a practical tool for implementing neural networks and deep learning models. Deep learning was introduced as a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training deep neural networks with multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were explained, which are specifically designed for image and pattern recognition tasks. The applications of CNNs were explored, highlighting their effectiveness in image lassification, object detection, and more. Autoencoders were introduced as unsupervised learning models used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.  The importance of deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, was emphasized for efficient implementation. Additional resources for deep learning were provided, including books, code libraries, and online tutorials.
