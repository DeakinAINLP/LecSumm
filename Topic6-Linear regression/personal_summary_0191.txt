 Many supervised learning-related topics were presented this topic. It began by going through several supervised learning techniques, then moved on to a supervised learning algorithm and the idea of model complexity. Together with structural risk minimization, the idea of Occam's razor and its connection to model complexity were examined.  The necessity of dividing data for training and testing, selecting the optimum hyperparameters for the model, classification and regression metrics used to assess the performance of supervised learning models, and more were also discussed over the topic.  It also explained how unbalanced classes affect a model's performance. The topic ended with an examination of well-known Python supervised learning tools and a linear regression implementation using the sci-kit learn module. Lastly, the impact of data size on regression error was discussed.
