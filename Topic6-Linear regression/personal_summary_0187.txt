  Most practical machine learning use cases involve supervised learning  Hypothesis space is the range of all possible functions  Loss function is a measure of accuracy  Model complexity is how complex the model is  Occamâ€™s razor is used to simplify a model and prevent over-fitting  Confusion matrix, ROC curve and F-1 measure are classification metrics  Regression metrics include mean square error, absolute error and explained variance  Data can be partitioned in different ways such as sub-sampling, stratified sampling and  cross-validation   A hyper-parameter is a value that is selected before the model is trained   Imbalanced classes can be fixed by methods such as re-sampling and at at the algorithmic level  I learned a lot of new things this topic. I learned about the details of supervised learning and the ways in which data is partitioned. I also learned about regression metrics and how they are used to evaluate the performance of a model. The python module helped me learn how to use cross validation and how to perform a linear regression.
