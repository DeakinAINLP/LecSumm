This topic covers a broad range of topics related the key points covered in this topic include: Forms of Supervised Learning . Some of : Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions on unseen data. There are two forms of supervised learning: regression and classification. A Supervised Learning Algorithm: categorized into parametric and non-parametric algorithms. Parametric algorithms assume a fixed number of parameters, whereas non-parametric algorithms do not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. The Concept of Model Complexity: Supervised learning algorithms can be Model complexity refers to the ability of a model to fit the training data. The more complex the model, the better it will fit the training data. However, a highly complex model may overfit the data and perform poorly on new, unseen data. Model Complexity and Occam's Razor: Occam's razor is the principle that the simplest explanation is usually the best. In machine learning, this means that a simpler model may perform better than a more complex one, especially if the data is limited. Structural Risk Minimization: finding the best model by balancing the complexity of the model and the amount of training data available. Classification Metrics  Structural risk minimization is a method of : Classification metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Regression Metrics : Regression metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a regression model. These metrics include mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared. Partitioning Data for Training and Testing and testing sets to evaluate the performance of a model on new, unseen data. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is generalizable.  Data is typically split into training  Finding the Best Hyperparameters: not learned from the data but are set by the user. Finding the best hyperparameters can improve the performance of the model. Effect of Imbalanced Classes Hyperparameters are parameters that are instances in each class is not equal. This can lead to biased models and poor performance. Various techniques can be used to address this issue. Exploring Python Packages for  Python offers many libraries for implementing supervised learning models, including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Fitting a Regression Line:  best fits the data. This can be done using various methods, including ordinary least squares and gradient descent. Multivariate Regression: Fitting a regression line involves finding the line that dependent variable using multiple independent variables. Linear Regression Model from scikit-learn.
