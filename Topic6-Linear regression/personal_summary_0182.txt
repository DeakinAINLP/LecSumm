   Supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning we have a labelled  feature in our training set, that is the y truth value is known in our training set. In unsupervised learning we are presented with data that has no known label. Some examples of supervised learning are:  o  Linear and Logistic Regression o  Classification Problems (Decision Tree, Random Forrest, Neural Networks)  Some unsupervised examples include:  o  Clustering o  Anomaly Detection o  Generative Models    Performance of supervised learning models. Some metrics that we use to measure  supervised learning models include:  o  Precision – proportion of true positives to all positive predictions made  o  Recall – proportion of true positives against all positive instances o  F1 Score – harmonic mean of precision and recall. o  Accuracy – proportion of correct predictions made by the model  𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁 𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑁   Confusion Matrix. The confusion matrix is a matrix that gives us the TP, FP, FN, and TN measures, respectively in a 2x2 matrix. It is used for calculating the accuracy, recall and precision.

For linear and logistic regression problems we can use the mean  squared error value or the explained variance (r2 coefficient) to determine the effectiveness of those models.
