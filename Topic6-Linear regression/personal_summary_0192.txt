Topic 5 discusses supervised learning and various algorithms covered within this category, regression being the prime discussion and in addition, performance of regression algorithms based on various metrics  like  recall,  f1,  accuracy,  ROC  ,etc.  An  emphasis  on  data  partitioning  for  training  and hyperparameter optimization is also covered.  Reading List Modules 5.1 to 5.4 cover basics of supervised learning, its types, how such an algorithm works and the model’s complexity. In 5.5 and 5.6, I studied regarding Occam’s razor and risk minimization.  After this we move on to performance and metrics in modules 5.7 and 5.8 and then in 5.9 to 5.10 data partitioning and hyper parameter optimization in introduced.  From 5.11 to 5.13 the imbalanced classes and fitting of regression is discussed which are crucial to implementation  of  regression  models.    Then  from  5.14  to  5.16  python  implementation  and performance  evaluation  of is  taught  using  sklearn.linearregression  and sklearn.metrics libraries.  linear  regression
