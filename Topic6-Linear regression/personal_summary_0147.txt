The main points covered in this topic are all about different forms of Supervised Learning, supervised learning algorithm, concept of model complexity and Occamâ€™s razor, structural risk minimisation, classification metrics, regression metrics, partitioning data for training and testing, finding the best hyperparameters and effect of imbalanced classes. Then we started to explore python packages for supervised learning, fitting a regression line, multivariate regression, linear regression model from sci-kit learn, evaluating our model, data size and regression error.
