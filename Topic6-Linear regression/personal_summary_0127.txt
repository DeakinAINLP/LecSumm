 The topics that were covered during topic 5 were model complexity, model assessment, model selection, how to assess any trained model and select the best model from set of models. Then, assessing and selecting the model using python packages.  I referred to the unit site contents for learning the topics that were covered in topic 5 along with the external video links provided.  The learning journey started with the basics of understanding forms of supervised learning which includes Regression problems, Classification problems and Ranking problems. Then, I acquired knowledge about the supervised learning algorithm, what is hypothesis space, Loss function and Empirical risk. I gained an idea on the concept of model complexity along with the effects of selecting different models in terms of complexity. Then, I gathered knowledge about Occamâ€™s razor which is a famous problem-solving technique along with structural risk minimization. Then, learnt about classification metrics , Confusion matrix, ROC curve, F-1 measure, Regression metrics which is the measure of how far the expected value is from the actual value and some of the ways to measure regression performance like Mean square error, R-Square. Later, got an overview of how to partition the data for training and testing, some of the techniques include random subsampling, stratified sampling and cross validation. Then, learnt about what is hyperparameter, why do we need them and how to identify the best hyperparameter for a specific model. Finally, I acquired knowledge on implementation of linear regression model using python program in which in regression weights can be estimated and visualized, python packages , fitting a linear regression line, multivariate regression, linear regression model from sci- kit learn, how to evaluate the model, the effect of data size on prediction performance.
