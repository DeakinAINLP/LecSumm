  Supervised learning is a sort of machine learning that involves training a model with labelled data. Classification and regression are the two primary types of supervised learning. The model predicts a categorical label for each input in classification, whereas the model predicts a continuous value in regression. Both types of supervised learning require a labelled dataset to train the model, and the choice is dictated by the type of problem being solved. Classification, for example, may be used to predict if an email is spam or not, whereas regression can be used to forecast the price of a home based on its attributes.    The degree of flexibility a model has in fitting the training data is referred to as  model complexity. A high-complexity model may fit the training data extremely well, but it may overfit and perform badly on fresh, unknown data. A model with minimal complexity, on the other hand, may underfit the training data and perform badly on both the training and test data. Finding the optimal degree of complexity for a model includes a trade-off between underfitting and overfitting, and it is a critical concern in machine learning.    Structural risk minimisation is a machine learning principle that seeks to balance a  model's complexity with its capacity to generalise to new data. The goal is to select a model that has a fair trade-off between training error and model complexity, such that it performs well not just on training data, but also on fresh, previously unknown data. Regularisation approaches, such as L1 and L2 regularisation, are widely used to apply structural risk minimisation by introducing a penalty term into the objective function to deter overfitting.    Classification metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of a classification model.  Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are some frequent measurements. Precision and recall assess the model's capacity to properly identify positive cases and prevent false positives and false negatives, while accuracy measures the total proportion of right predictions. The F1 score is a weighted average of accuracy and recall that gives a unified assessment of a model's performance.    Regression metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of a regression model. Mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score are all common measures. The average squared error between the anticipated and true values is measured by MSE and RMSE, with RMSE being the square root of MSE. The R2 score, which ranges from 0 to 1, represents the proportion of variation in the target variable explained by the model. Higher R2 scores and lower MSE and RMSE values imply superior model performance.    Techniques for splitting a dataset into training and testing subsets for machine learning include random subsampling, stratified sampling, and cross-validation. Random subsampling divides the dataset into training and testing subsets at random, whereas stratified sampling guarantees that each subset has a comparable distribution of target variables. Cross-validation entails splitting the dataset into k equal-sized subgroups and training and testing the model k times, with each subset acting as the testing set only once. Because it delivers a more accurate assessment of a model's performance on fresh, unseen data, cross-validation is frequently prefered over random subsampling and stratified sampling.    Imbalanced classes occur when one class has considerably more instances in a dataset than the other(s). This can lead to problems in machine learning models, since the model may get biassed towards the majority class and perform badly on the minority class. To balance the class distribution, techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and producing synthetic data can be utilised. To properly analyse model performance on unbalanced datasets, evaluation measures like as precision, recall, and F1 score should be utilised in addition to accuracy.
