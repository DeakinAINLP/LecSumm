 This topic we covered the fundamentals of supervised learning, which is a machine learning paradigm. The different forms of supervised learning, including regression problems, classification problems and ranking problems.  We covered model complexity and Occam’s razor.  We looked into various metrics on evaluating a machine learning model, including confusion matrix, ROC curve, and F-1 measure. Regression metrics. Also learnt about partitioning data for training and testing, allowing us to evaluate a model on data that it has never seen before (i.e. test data).  We covered finding the best hyperparameters, which are parameters who value is set before the learning process begins, that can’t be estimated from data.  We covered the effect of imbalanced classes.  We also went further in depth to linear regression, which is a supervised machine learning model.
