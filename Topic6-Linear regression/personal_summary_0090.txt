 Summary: Through my study of Topic 5 I learnt by reading the content, watching the videos, taking notes and working through the activities. Evidence can be seen below.  Activity 5.2:  1.  Forms of Supervised Learning a.  Regression problems  i.  Linear Regression (linear model) ii.  Logistic Regression (linear model  b.  Classification problems  i.  Support Vector Machines (both linear and nonlinear)             ii.  Decision Trees (nonlinear) iii.  Random Forest (nonlinear) iv.  Neural Networks: Perceptron and Multi-layer Perceptron (nonlinear)  c.  Ranking problems  Activity 5.3:  1.  Supervised learning algorithm a.  Hypothesis space b.  Finding a function c.  Loss function  i.  Square loss ii.  Absolute loss iii.  0-1 loss iv.  Logistic loss v.  Hinge loss  d.  Empirical risk  Activity 5.4:  1.  model complexity 2.  overfitting vs underfitting  Activity 5.5:  1.  Occam’s razor ML model, simplest is best.  Activity 5.6:  1.  Structural Risk, aimed at rewarding simpler functions over complex.  Activity 5.7:  1.  Classification metrics  a.  Confusion Matrix/contingency tables. b.  True Positive Rate (TPR) or Recall or Sensitivity c.  False positive rate (FPR) d.  Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC Curve) e.  Area Un der the Curve (AUC) Youden index f.  F-1 Measure  Activity 5.8: Regression Metrics  1.  Measuring regression performance 2.  Mean Square Error 3.  Explained Variance (R2)       Activity 5.9: Partitioning data for training and testing  random subsampling     stratified sampling   cross validation  Activity 5.10: Hyperparameters  Activity 5.11: Imbalanced classes  At the data level: (Re-Sampling)    over-sampling the data from minority class   under-sampling the data from majority class.  At the algorithmic level:    adjusting the costs   adjusting the decision threshold.  Activity 5.12: Python packages for supervised learning  Linear Regression            Activity 5.13: Fitting a regression line  I don’t think I have the same dataset available for this task but I used the one from the previous exercise.      Activity 5.14: Multivariate regression  Activity 5.15: Linear regression model from sci-kit learn       Activity 5.16: Evaluating our model Feature correlation between the features and classes using Heatmap  Activity 5.17: Data size and regression error    model to use: Linear regression in our case     training data testing data training sizes: the different sizes of training data to use
