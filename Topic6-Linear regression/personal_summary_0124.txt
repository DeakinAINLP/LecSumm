Over the past topic, I have gained knowledge on various topics related to machine learning. These include ensemble learning techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking, as well as deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. Additionally, I have learned about unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, and evaluation metrics for classification models including precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Furthermore, I have learned about techniques for addressing class imbalance in datasets, such as oversampling and under sampling, and the bias- variance trade-off in model complexity.  To supplement the course materials, I have also read several external resources related to machine learning. These include "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurelian Geron, the scikit-learn documentation on ensemble methods and evaluation metrics, and the TensorFlow documentation on deep learning models and training. Additionally, I have read several research papers on unsupervised learning techniques, including k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA).  Through this topic's content, I have gained a deeper understanding of various machine learning techniques and their applications. I have learned about important considerations when building and evaluating machine learning models, such as the importance of data pre-processing, the impact of class imbalance on model performance, and the trade-off between model complexity and generalization performance. Additionally, I have gained practical experience in implementing machine learning algorithms using popular libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.  Overall, I feel that I have made significant progress in my understanding of machine learning and its potential applications. I am now equipped with the knowledge and skills to tackle real-world problems using machine learning techniques, and I am excited to continue learning and exploring this field.
