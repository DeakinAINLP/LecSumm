Supervised learning refers to a machine learning algorithm where labelled data is used to train the computer. In labelled data, the input data is paired with the corresponding output data. The objective of supervised learning is to create a function that can predict output accurately for new input data. Several forms of supervised learning algorithms exist, such as regression, classification, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Each of these algorithms has its own set of advantages and limitations, and choosing the appropriate algorithm depends on the nature of the problem and the available data.  Supervised learning algorithms function by instructing a machine learning model using a dataset that is labeled, meaning that it includes input data alongside their corresponding output data. The primary aim of the algorithm is to learn a function that can make precise predictions on new input data.  In the training phase, the algorithm studies the labeled data and strives to detect patterns and relationships between the input and output data. It modifies the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output in the labeled data.  Once the model is trained on the labeled dataset, it can be utilized to make predictions on new input data. The model applies the learned function to the new input data to generate a forecasted output.  The algorithm uses a distinct testing dataset to assess the performance of the model. The accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing its projected outputs to the actual outputs in the testing dataset. If the model shows good performance on the testing dataset, it is considered to possess robust generalization capability and can be utilized for making predictions on unseen data.  Model complexity refers to the level of intricacy or sophistication of a model, which is often associated with the number of parameters or features incorporated in the model in machine learning. While a complex model may be capable of capturing intricate relationships in the data, it may also be more prone to overfitting or making incorrect predictions on new data.  Occam's razor is a principle that advocates for choosing the simplest explanation or model when multiple explanations or models exist for a given phenomenon. In machine learning, this means that simpler models should be preferred over complex models if both perform similarly on the data. This principle guards against overfitting and promotes the use of simpler models that are easier to understand and more likely to generalize well to new data.  Data partitioning is the procedure of dividing a dataset into subsets that can be utilized for training, validation, and testing in machine learning. There are multiple data partitioning schemes that are frequently used in machine learning:  Hold-out: This method includes dividing the dataset into two subsets, a training set and a testing set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.  Cross-validation: This approach involves dividing the dataset into k equal-sized subsets, or folds. The model is trained on k-1 folds and evaluated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the testing set once. The results are averaged across all folds to obtain the final performance metrics.  Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV): This is a special case of k-fold cross- validation where k is equal to the number of samples in the dataset. In each iteration, the model is trained on all samples except one, which is used for testing. This process is repeated for each sample in the dataset.  Stratified Sampling: This method involves partitioning the dataset into subsets that maintain the same proportion of classes as the original dataset. This ensures that the training, validation, and testing subsets have a similar distribution of classes as the original dataset.  The selection of a data partitioning scheme depends on various factors, such as the dataset size, model complexity, and class distribution in the dataset.
