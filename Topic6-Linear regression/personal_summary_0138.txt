This topic's main topic is supervised learning. Including model complexity, evaluation index, algorithm, python practice  Model complexity  The  model  needs  to  be  sufficiently  complex  to  simulate  that  it  will  underfit.  But  too  high complexity will cause overfitting. Structural risk is introduced as value at risk. Prevent overfitting by minimizing structural risk.  Evaluation Index  Use a chaos matrix to summarize forecast results. We can use ROC Curve to balance the true and false positive rates trade-offs. F1-measure can also be used. Regression metrics can evaluate the difference between data and actual data. Examples include mean squared error and R squared.  Algorithm  When using supervised learning, you need to use partial data for validation. Divide the data into training data and validation data. Uses: random sampling, stratified sampling, cross-validation. Random sampling randomly splits the data. Stratified sampling ensures that the proportion of each data  category  in  the  training  and  validation  data  is  the  same.  Cross-validation  divides  the  data equally, using one part for verification and the rest for iterative training.  python practice  Practice fitting regression lines and multiple regression. Use the sci-kit learn package for linear  regression. Practice evaluating models using mean squared error.
