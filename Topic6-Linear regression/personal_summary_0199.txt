This topic we covered the topic of supervised learning. Speciﬁcally looking at ways to analyse data using regression and analysing the performance of those models.  The types of supervised learning covered were regression problems (solved using linear and logis(cid:415)c regression), classiﬁca(cid:415)on problems (solved using support vector machines, decision trees, random forest, and neural networks) and ranking problems. Evalua(cid:415)ng our learning models is done using mean squared error, model weights and heatmaps.  Reﬂec(cid:415)on I found the topics covered in this topic are presented in a way that was understandable and made sense to me. While also being interes(cid:415)ng and useful.
