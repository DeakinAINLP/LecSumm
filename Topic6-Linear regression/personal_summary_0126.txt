In this topic I have learned various machine learning topics. I have learned ensemble learning techniques as bagging, boosting and stacking algorithm. I also got to know about number of frameworks as TensorFlow, eras etc. In the first quarter of topic 5 I have learned about various supervised learning algorithms. I have learned about various forms of supervised learnings such as regression problems, Classification problems and Ranking problems. The regression problems can be solved into two ways as linear regression and logistic regression which are based for linear data models.  Coming to the ways for solving the classification problems we have support vector machines which is for linear and non-linear types of data, Decision trees, Random Forest and neural networks for non-linear problems.  I have learned about a famous concept called model complexity and Occamâ€™s razor and the principle simply says that the simple solution is the best keeping all other things equal. I have also understood the structural risk management which depicts the techniques and ways to reduce the risk of overall process.  After going through all the topic 5 concepts I have tried to complete the task which was given as pass activity and the results are attached with this file.
