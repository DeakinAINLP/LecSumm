First: I read and researched all the resources and articles in topic 5 of Learning  Resources.    Second: I joined an online Python class.   Third: I have read and watched Machine Learning resources from my mother tongue to  English as well.    Fourth: I also watch, read, and learn about Python-related issues in both languages.   Lastly: I bought the Machine Learning Online Course.

Supervised learning is a technique in machine learning that uses labeled data to train a model to make predictions based on new, unseen data. The algorithm learns from a labeled dataset with input and output data. It learns to map input data to the correct output label or value.  Types of Supervised Learning:  1.  Regression: Output is a continuous value. Examples include predicting house prices,  stock prices, and temperature.  2.  Classification: Output is a discrete value. Examples include email spam detection,  sentiment analysis, and image classification.  3.  Ranking: Goal is to rank a set of items in order of relevance. Examples include search  engine ranking and recommender systems.  Classification Metrics:  1.  Confusion Matrix: Shows true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false  negatives in classification.  2.  ROC Curve: Graphical representation of a binary classification model's performance. 3.  F-1 Measure: Popular metric for evaluating classification models.  Regression Data: Continuous data with a continuous output variable and input variables that can be continuous, categorical, or a mix. Examples include predicting house prices based on location, size, and number of bedrooms.  Partitioning Data: Essential in supervised learning. Training set is used to train the model, and testing set is used to evaluate model performance.  Model Complexity, Evaluation, and Selection: Choose the right level of complexity to avoid overfitting or underfitting. Measure model performance on testing data. Choose the best model among a set of candidates.  Python Packages for Supervised Learning:  1.  Regression Line: for linear regression analysis. 2.  Multivariate Regression: for multiple regression analysis. 3.  Linear Regression Model from scikit-learn: provides a simple interface for building linear  regression models.  Data Size and Regression Error: Size of the data can affect regression error. As the size of the data increases, the regression error decreases. It is important to balance the size of the data with computational resources available.
