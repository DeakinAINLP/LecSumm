1.  Fundamentals of Supervised Learning is to learn key concepts important for supervised  learning, such as model complexity, model assessment, and model selection.  Understanding these concepts will help assess any trained model and select the best model  from a set of models using Python packages. In addition, the previous two topics covered  unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and dimensionality reduction, and  how to use them in practical applications. By the end of topics 5 and 6, learners will be  able to differentiate supervised learning from unsupervised learning, estimate the  performance of different supervised learning models, implement model selection, and  compute relevant evaluation measures.  Forms of Supervised Learning  Supervised learning involves developing a mapping function between input and output  based on labeled training data. The training data is arranged in the form of input-output  pairs. Examples of supervised learning include regression (linear and logistic),  classification (support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, neural networks),  and ranking problems. Regression problems involve predicting a continuous output while  classification problems involve predicting discrete output classes. Supervised learning has  advantages over unsupervised learning because the output is known and can be used to test  the algorithm. Examples of supervised learning applications include predicting yogurt sales  based on temperature, stock price prediction, and classification of data with linear or  nonlinear boundaries.  A supervised learning algorithm  In supervised learning, a learning algorithm seeks to find a function that accurately maps  input data to corresponding output data. This is achieved by selecting a hypothesis function  that is similar to the true function, and then using a loss function to measure the accuracy  of the hypothesis function. The goal is to minimize the empirical risk, which is the average  of the loss function over the training data, in order to find the function that represents the  true relationship between input and output. The supervised learning algorithm is trained  using an optimization algorithm to minimize the empirical risk. The choice of hypothesis  space and loss function depends on the specific problem being addressed.   The concept of model complexity  The concept of model complexity in machine learning refers to the balance between over-  fitting and under-fitting. If the model is too complex, it may fit the training data too well,  leading to over-fitting, while if it is too simple, it may not capture the underlying patterns  in the data, leading to under-fitting. The right complexity of the model depends on the  problem at hand and the available data. The goal is to find the optimal complexity that  generalises well on unseen data. In order to achieve this, one needs to balance between the  bias and variance of the model. Generally, more complex models have lower bias but  higher variance, while simpler models have higher bias but lower variance. A trade-off is  needed to achieve the right balance.  Model complexity and Occam's razor  In the context of machine learning, Occam's Razor can guide us in choosing the best model  complexity. The simplest model that fits the data well is often the best choice. This is  because simpler models are less likely to overfit, that is, they will not capture the noise in  the training data and will have better generalization performance on unseen data. On the  other hand, more complex models can fit the training data well but may not generalize well  to new data. Therefore, we should choose a model that is not too simple and not too  complex, but just the right amount of complexity that balances between fit and  generalization.  Structural risk minimisation  What is the principle of Occam's Razor?  The principle of Occam's Razor states that, all other things being equal, the simplest  solution is the best. It recommends selecting the theory that introduces the fewest  assumptions and has the least complexity, especially when multiple competing theories are  equal in other respects.  In other words, the structural risk minimization principle tries to balance the fit of the  model to the training data (empirical risk) and the complexity of the model (structural risk)   by adding a regularization term to the objective function. The regularization term penalizes  complex models, and the trade-off between the two terms is controlled by the penalty  parameter Î». The goal is to find the model that has the lowest overall risk, which is a  combination of the empirical and structural risks.  Classification metrics  In summary, when evaluating a classification model, accuracy may not be a reliable metric,  especially for imbalanced class problems. Confusion matrix provides a more detailed  evaluation by calculating true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). Receiver  Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve helps to depict the trade-off between TPR and FPR  at various threshold settings, and can be used to calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC)  and Youden Index. F-1 measure is another useful metric that combines both Precision and  Recall in a single number. The choice of evaluation metrics depends on the specific  problem and the associated costs of different types of errors.  F-1 measure is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a way to balance  both metrics. The formula for F-1 measure is:  F-1 measure = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)  where precision = TP / (TP + FP) and recall = TP / (TP + FN)  F-1 measure ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the best possible performance. The F-1  measure is a useful metric in cases where both precision and recall are important, such as  in information retrieval or medical diagnosis.  Regression Metrics  In regression analysis, we try to find the relationship between a dependent variable (target)  and one or more independent variables (features) and use it to make predictions on new  data. The performance of a regression model is measured using various metrics such as  Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error    (MAE), and Explained Variance (R-squared or coefficient of determination). MSE, RMSE,  and MAE measure the distance between the predicted values and the actual values, while  R-squared measures the percentage of variance in the dependent variable that can be  explained by the independent variables. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of  the model to the data.  Regression metrics are used to measure the performance of a regression model. Mean  Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  are commonly used metrics to measure how close the predictions are to the true target  values. Explained Variance (R-square) is another measure that indicates the percentage of  target variation explained by the model. The higher the R-square of a model, the better its  performance.  Partitioning data for training and testing  Cross-validation is a popular method for partitioning data because it makes efficient use of  the available data for testing and provides a more reliable estimate of model performance  than a single training/testing split. Additionally, it is especially useful when the dataset size  is limited, which is often the case in many real-world applications.  By repeating the process of partitioning data into training and testing sets multiple times,  cross-validation allows us to evaluate the performance of our model on multiple  independent test sets. This helps us to better understand how our model generalizes to new  data and provides us with a more reliable estimate of model performance.  In order to assess the performance of a trained model, it is important to use a reliable  estimate of accuracy.  This can be achieved through partitioning data into training and testing sets. Multiple  training/test splits can be used, such as random subsampling, stratified sampling, and cross-  validation.  Random subsampling repeatedly partitions the data into random training and test sets in a  specified ratio, and the model is trained and evaluated on each split. Stratified sampling   ensures that class proportions are maintained in each random set. Cross-validation  partitions the data into equal sized sub-samples and iteratively leaves out one sub-sample  for testing, while training on the rest of the sub-samples.  The final accuracy is the average of the accuracies obtained in each iteration, making  efficient use of the available data for testing. Leave-one-out cross-validation is a special  case of cross-validation where each instance is left out for testing.  Finding the best hyperparameters  hyperparameters are parameters whose value is set before the learning process begins in  machine learning. They are often tuned for a given predictive modelling problem. To find  the best hyperparameter for a specific model, we need to partition training data into  separate training and validation sets. A validation set is used to evaluate a given model and  also to fine-tune the model hyperparameters. We can find the best hyperparameter by  defining a search grid within a specified range, training a model using each hyperparameter  value from the search grid and assessing its performance on a validation set, and finally  selecting the hyperparameter value with the best performance. Internal cross-validation can  also be used to select the best set of hyperparameters within a training set. Grid-search,  random search, and Bayesian optimization are possible ways to navigate the  hyperparameter space.  Finding the best hyperparameters covers the importance of hyperparameters in machine  learning models and how to find the best hyperparameters for a given predictive modeling  problem. The key takeaways are:  Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins  and cannot be estimated from data.  The validation set is used to fine-tune the model hyperparameters, whereas the test set is  used to evaluate the model's performance in an unbiased way.  To find the best hyperparameters, we need to define a possible range for hyperparameters,  create a search grid within the specified range, train a model using each hyperparameter  value from the search grid, assess its performance on a validation set, and select the one  with the best performance.  Internal cross-validation can be used to select the best set of hyperparameters within a  training set.  There are different techniques to navigate the hyperparameter space, including grid-search,  random search, and Bayesian optimization.  finding the best hyperparameters is an essential step in machine learning model  development, as it can significantly impact the model's performance.  Effect of imbalanced classes  Imbalanced data is indeed a common challenge in machine learning and it can significantly  affect the accuracy of our models. As you mentioned, there are different approaches to  address this issue.  One additional solution at the algorithmic level is to use ensemble techniques such as  bagging, boosting, and stacking. These methods combine multiple models to create a more  robust and accurate classifier, which can handle imbalanced data more effectively. Another  approach is to use anomaly detection techniques, which can identify and separate the  minority class from the majority class.  Regarding the issues of imbalanced classes, it is important to note that accuracy is not a  reliable metric for evaluating models trained on imbalanced data. Instead, we should use  metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score that take into account both true positives and  false positives. Also, stratified sampling can help ensure that the class proportion is  maintained in each partition during random subsampling.  And yes, overfitting on the test set is a common mistake in machine learning. It is  important to use proper evaluation techniques such as cross-validation to avoid this issue.  Additionally, we should always avoid using any information that is not available at  prediction time in our models.  The imbalanced class problem is common in many machine learning applications where  one class of data significantly outweighs the other. This can cause problems for algorithms  that perform better with a balanced dataset. Two approaches to solving this problem   include data-level techniques such as over-sampling or under-sampling, and algorithmic-  level techniques such as adjusting costs or decision thresholds. Issues with imbalanced  classes include problems with accuracy metrics and class proportion in random  subsampling. It is important to remember to not use information that is not available during  the training process and to avoid overfitting on a specified test set.  Exploring Python packages for supervised learning  The learning outcome from exploring Python packages for supervised learning involves  fitting a linear regression model to a regression dataset and studying the behavior of the  linear regression model. The objective is to write a program to read the provided regression  dataset and split it into training and test sets in a given ratio, and to write code for a linear  regression model to estimate regression weights and visualize it. The example dataset used  is about predicting profits from a food truck franchise in cities based on their population.  The performance of the learning model is measured using mean square error (MSE), and  the size of the data affects the MSE. The necessary libraries used in the exercise include  numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Various data visualization techniques like violin  plots and scatter plots are used to understand the distribution and relationship between the  features and the target variable.   The train_test_split function from the sklearn library is used to split the dataset into  training and test sets. We use the LinearRegression class from sklearn.linear_model to fit a  linear regression model on the training set. The predict method is used to predict on the test  set, and mean_squared_error function from sklearn.metrics is used to compute the mean  square error on the test set.  Fitting a regression line  The article explains how to fit a simple regression line using the closed form solution. The  regression line takes the form y = w0 + w1*x, where w0 is the intercept and w1 is the  slope. The article provides code examples using Python to show how to implement the  closed form solution to fit the regression line. The examples also show how to use the  fitted model to make predictions. The article concludes by mentioning that the next lesson  will cover a multivariate example.  This code example shows how to fit a simple linear regression line using the closed form  solution. The code uses the food truck profits dataset, calculates the value of the slope and  sets the intercept value, and then uses the closed form solution to find the optimal values  for the slope and intercept. Finally, it plots the regression line and predicts the profit for a  population of size 175,000.        Multivariate regression  In this example, we learned about multivariate regression, which is a statistical method  used to predict a dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. We also  learned about the importance of dividing the dataset into training and testing datasets to  evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.  We used the train_test_split method from the scikit-learn library to split the dataset into  training and testing data. Finally, we printed the shapes of the training and testing datasets  to confirm the split, and checked the types of the X and y variables, which should be  numpy arrays.  Multivariate regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between  multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. In this technique, we use two or  more predictor variables to make predictions about the response variable. The goal is to  find a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable, and  then use that relationship to make predictions about new data.  To build a multivariate regression model, we start by dividing the dataset into two parts: a  training dataset and a testing dataset. We use the training dataset to build the model and the  testing dataset to evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data. We can use the  train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library to split the data into training and  testing sets.  Once the data is split, we can use various methods, such as ordinary least squares, to fit a  linear regression model to the training data. We can then use this model to predict the  target variable for new data. The quality of the model can be evaluated using various  metrics, such as mean squared error, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared.       Linear regression model from sci-kit learn  The Linear Regression model from scikit-learn package is a powerful tool for building  regression models. Some of the key learning outcomes of using Linear Regression from  scikit-learn are:  1.  Importing and cleaning data: Before fitting a model, we need to clean the data and remove  any missing values or outliers. Scikit-learn provides many tools to clean and preprocess  data.  2.  Train/test split: To evaluate the performance of the model, we need to split the data into a  training set and a testing set.  3.  Model building: Using the Linear Regression () function from scikit-learn, we can build a  linear regression model to predict the target variable based on one or more features.  4.  Model evaluation: Once the model is built, we can use it to make predictions on the test set  and evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error, R-squared, or mean  absolute error.  5.  Visualization: Scikit-learn provides many visualization tools to help us explore the data  and the model, including scatter plots, line plots, and histograms.  Overall, scikit-learn provides a powerful and flexible framework for building and  evaluating linear regression models.  Evaluating our model  Measuring the discrepancy between the truth and the predictions using Mean Square Error  (MSE), which measures how well our prediction fits the true data. The MSE value can be  obtained using the code example #2 shown above. Additionally, we can also analyze the  correlation between different features and the target using a heatmap, as shown in code  example #1. Lastly, we can retrieve the model weights and intercepts using code example  #3.  learning outcomes for evaluating a machine learning model are:  1.  Discrepancy measurement: We need to measure the discrepancy between the truth and the  predictions made by our model. Mean Square Error (MSE) is a common metric to measure  the deviation from the true data.  2.  Feature correlation: It's important to analyze the correlation between features and target  variables. A heatmap is a useful tool to visualize the correlation between different feature  sets.  3.  Model weights and intercepts: It's possible to retrieve the model weights and intercepts  from the trained model. These values can provide insights into how the model is making its  predictions.  Code example #1 shows how to use a heatmap to visualize the correlation between  different feature sets.  Code example #2 demonstrates how to calculate the Mean Square Error of a model.  Code example #3 shows how to retrieve the model weights and intercepts.  Data size and regression error  The plot shows the change in model mean squared error (MSE) with respect to increasing  size of training data. As we can see, the MSE decreases as the size of training data  increases, indicating that increasing the amount of training data generally improves the  prediction performance of the model. However, we can also see that there is a point of  diminishing returns, after which increasing the size of training data has less of an impact on  reducing the MSE. In this case, the minimum MSE is achieved at a training data size of  around 100.  exploring the effect of data size on prediction performance using linear regression as the  model. We defined a function that takes in the model, training data, testing data, and  training sizes, and returns the model's MSE and weights for each training size. We then  plotted the change in MSE with respect to the increasing size of training data.  The results showed that as the size of training data increases, the MSE decreases,  indicating that the model performs better with more data. This is a common observation in  machine learning and underscores the importance of having sufficient data for model  training.   2.  There are several key takeaways from the exercises discussed so far:  a.  Data preprocessing: Before building a model, it is important to preprocess the data to make  it suitable for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical  variables, and scaling the data.  b.  Model selection: There are many different models that can be used for regression tasks,  and it is important to select the appropriate one based on the characteristics of the data and  the goals of the analysis.  c.  Model evaluation: Once a model has been built, it is important to evaluate its performance  using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared. Cross-  validation techniques such as k-fold and leave-one-out can help to ensure that the model is  not overfitting to the training data.  d.  Impact of data size: The amount of data used to train a model can have a significant impact  on its performance. In general, more data leads to better performance, although there may  be diminishing returns beyond a certain point.  e.  Bias-variance tradeoff: When building a model, it is important to balance the bias and  variance of the model. A model with high bias will underfit the data, while a model with  high variance will overfit the data. Techniques such as regularization can help to balance  the bias and variance of the model.
