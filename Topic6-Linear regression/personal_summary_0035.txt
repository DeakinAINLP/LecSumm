The key points covered in topic five are:  1.  Supervised learning, primarily regression and classification.  Regression is where given the input data, a specific value is predicted e.g., the predicted temperature while classification will predict if the input sample belongs to one or more categories e.g., if it will rain or not rain.  2.  Evaluation of supervised learning models: Using regression metrics such as RMSE and R-squared for regression problems and classification metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 and AUC for classification problems.  3.  Data splitting methods such as random, stratified, and cross validation to create a training and  test set.  4.  Hyperparameter tuning using Grid and Random search and splitting the training set to create a  validation set to select the best hyperparameters.  5.  Model complexity and controlling overfitting and underfitting. 6. 7.  Python libraries such as seaborn, model_selection, scikitlearn, scipy, LinearRegression.  Impacts and issues related to class imbalance.
