TOPIC 5: FUNDAMENTALS OF SUPERVISED LEARNING  Different forms of supervised learning which includes regression ● whereby a single output value is produced using training data. This value is a probabilistic interpretation, which is ascertained after considering the strength of correlation among the input variables and classification which involves grouping the data into classes. ●  Concept of a supervised learning algorithm. Model complexity as a measure of how accurately a machine  ● learning model can predict unseen data, as well as how much data the model needs to see in order to make good predictions. ● is used as a heuristic guide in the development of theoretical models. ●  Learning the model complexity and Occam’s razor, Occam’s razor  Structural risk minimisation based on Occam’s razor. Classification metric as a number that measure the performance  Regression metrics, it refers to predictive modelling problems that  ● the machine learning model when it comes to assigning observations to certain classes. ● involves predicting a numeric value. Concept of partitioning data for training and testing as well as ● splitting of data using random subsampling, stratified sampling, and cross validation methods. ● whose value is set before the learning process begins. Negative effect of imbalanced classes as they occur where the ● total number of one class of data is far less than the total number of another class of data outcomes. ● a linear regression model to a regression dataset ● packages in python.  How to find best hyperparameters, hyperparameter is a parameter  Exploring python packages for supervised learning including fitting  Concept of multivariate regression including installing the  Fitting in multivariate regression using linear regression model  ● from schi-kit learn.  The effect of data size on predicting performance and the  ● regression error.
