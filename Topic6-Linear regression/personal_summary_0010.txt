1) A labelled dataset is used to train an algorithm for supervised learning, which involves learning a mapping between input attributes and matching output labels. For fresh inputs that the algorithm has never seen before, the objective is to anticipate the proper label. There are many types of supervised learnings some of the forms are regression problems, classification problems and ranking problems etc. 2) One of the most important factors in machine learning is model complexity. Simply expressed, it refers to the quantity of independent variables, characteristics, or predictors that a model must include to provide reliable predictions. 3)The classification metrics can be explained as a classification metric, expressed simply, is a figure that represents how well your machine learning model performs when classifying observations. In the case of binary classification, there are only two possible classes: positive and negative. 4) Problems involving the prediction of a numerical value fall under regression predictive modelling. Regression metrics entail computing an error score to encapsulate a model's capacity for prediction. What are the formulas for calculating and reporting mean squared error, root mean squared error, and mean etc. 5) A supervised machine learning approach called multivariate regression uses numerous data variables for analysis. One dependent variable and several independent variables make up a multivariate regression, which is an extension of multiple regression. We attempt to forecast the result based on how many independent factors there are. 6)Then we have discussed some coding examples and some concepts which are reacted to regression model and splitting data.
