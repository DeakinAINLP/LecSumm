 In topic five, we covered the different forms of supervised learning, including regression, classification, and ranking problems. We also learned about various supervised learning algorithm methods, like hypothesis space, finding a function, and error function. The lecture also deeply covered model complexity, structural risk minimisation, and classification metrics.  To gain a deeper understanding of this topic, I read a few chapters from w3schools about Python and machine learning and watched youtube videos of machine learning programs. Additionally, I reviewed more tricks and applications of the sklearn, sci-kit libraries, and numpy.
