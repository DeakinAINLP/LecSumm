➢  Supervised Learning Algorithm : An algorithm for machine learning that is trained on labeled data is known as supervised learning. Features or attributes make up the input data, and labels or target values make up the output data. In order to predict the output values for new, unforeseen input data, the algorithm aims to learn a mapping function between the input and output data.  ➢  SRM :  An algorithm for machine learning that is trained on labeled data is known as  supervised learning. Features or attributes make up the input data, and labels or target values make up the output data. In order to predict the output values for new, unforeseen input data, the algorithm aims to learn a mapping function between the input and output data.  ➢  Confusion Matrix : A table that summarizes how well a classification algorithm  performed on a set of labeled data is known as a confusion matrix. The number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class in the classification problem are displayed in the confusion matrix.
