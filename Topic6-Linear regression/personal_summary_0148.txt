I learned several concepts this topic related to machine learning. In the ﬁ(cid:332)h and sixth topics of the course, we focused on supervised learning, which involves developing a mapping func(cid:415)on between input and output variables using labeled training data. We also learned about unsupervised learning, which includes clustering and dimensionality reduc(cid:415)on. The appropriate complexity of a machine learning model depends on the problem and data available. Overﬁ(cid:427)ng and underﬁ(cid:427)ng can occur when the model is too complex or too simple, respec(cid:415)vely. To address this issue, we learned about Occam's Razor principle, which helps us select a simpler model that generalizes well. Structural risk minimiza(cid:415)on balances the trade-oﬀ between ﬁ(cid:427)ng the training data well and ﬁnding a model that generalizes well by adding a penalty term to the objec(cid:415)ve func(cid:415)on that measures the model's complexity.  We also learned about classiﬁca(cid:415)on metrics, which are important for evalua(cid:415)ng the performance of a machine learning model. We learned about the confusion matrix, which is a summary of the model's predic(cid:415)on results for a classiﬁca(cid:415)on problem. We also learned that accuracy is not a reliable metric for imbalanced class problems, so other metrics like True Posi(cid:415)ve Rate (TPR) and False Posi(cid:415)ve Rate (FPR) are used. Addi(cid:415)onally, we learned about the Receiver Opera(cid:415)ng Characteris(cid:415)cs (ROC) curve, which is used to depict the trade- oﬀ between TPR and FPR at various threshold se(cid:427)ngs. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) and the F-1 measure are useful sta(cid:415)s(cid:415)cs that can be calculated via ROC curve.  Moreover, we learned about the importance of using mul(cid:415)ple training/tes(cid:415)ng sets for model selec(cid:415)on to get a reliable es(cid:415)mate of model performance. We also learned about hyperparameters in machine learning and why they are important. We learned how to ﬁnd the best hyperparameter for a speciﬁc model, which involves par(cid:415)(cid:415)oning the data into training, valida(cid:415)on, and test sets and using techniques such as grid-search, random search, or Bayesian op(cid:415)miza(cid:415)on to navigate the hyperparameter space. We also covered internal cross-valida(cid:415)on, which can be used to select the best set of hyperparameters within a training set.  We also learned about imbalanced classes, which is a problem that can occur in machine learning when the number of instances of one class is much higher or lower than another class. This can cause issues when training models, especially in cases where posi(cid:415)ve outcomes are rare. We learned about two ways to address this problem: by manipula(cid:415)ng the data or by adjus(cid:415)ng the algorithm. We also discussed the poten(cid:415)al issues with imbalanced classes, such as the possibility of high accuracy from a dumb classiﬁer and random subsampling not maintaining class propor(cid:415)on.  Furthermore, we learned about ﬁ(cid:427)ng a regression line using a simple linear regression model. We saw some examples to calculate the closed-form solu(cid:415)on of the model, plot the regression line, and predict the proﬁt for a speciﬁc popula(cid:415)on size. We also learned how to split the data into training and tes(cid:415)ng datasets and evaluate the model's performance using scikit-learn package. Addi(cid:415)onally, we explored the rela(cid:415)onship between data size and predic(cid:415)on performance using a linear regression model. We deﬁned a func(cid:415)on that takes the model to use, training data, tes(cid:415)ng data, and the diﬀerent sizes of training data to use.   The func(cid:415)on trains the model on diﬀerent sizes of training data and records the model weights and mean squared error (MSE) for each training size. Then, we plo(cid:425)ed the change in model MSE with respect to the increasing size of training data. By doing this, we could observe how increasing the size of training data aﬀects the predic(cid:415)on performance of our model. So to conclude, I can say I learned mul(cid:415)ple concepts this topic and I also learned to use some packages like skit in this topic. I am also a(cid:425)aching this topic’s quiz result-
