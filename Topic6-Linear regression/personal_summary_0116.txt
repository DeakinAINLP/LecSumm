 The topic mainly talks about supervised learning. First, it talks about the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning. It also talks about the classification of the performance evaluation of supervised learning in which the idea of model complexity is important. After that, it talks about how to reduce structural risk. The Confusion Matrix and its concerning metrics are also mentioned in this chapter. Then it mentions some regression metrics such as Mean Square Error(MSE) while measuring regression performance. Subsequently, it introduces the partition method and cross-validation method. Furthermore, It elaborates on the method of finding the best hyperparameters by using a validation set. In the meantime, the effects of imbalanced classes and countermeasures against these are also noted. Thereafter, it tells me how to use Python to program to achieve a prediction based on linear regression and evaluation of the trained model. Through this study, I mainly refer to some provided videos and some external links. In addition, Bing chat also taught me a lot of related knowledge. The most impressive knowledge is the evaluation of a model because it can let me compare performances between different models.
