In topic 5, we learned about supervised learning, a subcategory of machine learning that uses labelled datasets to train an algorithm to classify data or to predict an outcome. We covered the different forms of supervised learning, such as regression, classification and ranking problems, and some examples of these different forms. The complexity of models was also discussed, including when and how a complex model should be used. We looked at confusion matrices as a way to understand the types of errors made by a model. As accuracy is important in determining the validity of the results, we also went in depth about the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) as ways to measure and compare the accuracy of our results. Tying in to precision and accuracy, we looked at other ways to express and evaluate how close the predicted values were to the true values, one way was through the mean square error (MSE), which calculates a value expressing how close the two values are, with the lower the value representing a more accurate prediction, with a score of 0 being exactly correct.  While learning about these different concepts and implementing them into my code, I did not need to refer to outside sources as I had in previous topics. The only outside sources I had reference were the ones provided by the unit in the topicly content pages.
