Topic  fifth  covered  Supervised  learning,  which  involves  several  key  forms  of supervised  learning,  for  example,  regression  problems,  classification  problems  and ranking problems. The lecture also delved into various methods of supervised learning algorithms,  such  as  hypothesis  space,  finding  a  function  and  error  function.  The lecture  also  provided  a  deep  understanding  of  model  complexity,  structural  risk minimisation, and classification metrics, including sci-kit processes in Python to train test  data,  split  methods  and  create  regression  lines.  Other  topics  included  the evaluation of the model.
