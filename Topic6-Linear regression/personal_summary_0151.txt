Supervised learning is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence where a computer algorithm is trained on input data that has been labeled for a specific output. In simpler words, we have a target variable in the dataset.  In supervised learning, classification and regression are two main types of problems that can be solved using different algorithms. The main difference between classification and regression is the type of output that is predicted. In classification, the goal is to predict a discrete class label, such as identifying whether an email is spam or not. In contrast, regression is used to predict a continuous quantity, such as predicting the price of a house based on its features. Another difference is the type of algorithms used. Classification algorithms include decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM), while regression algorithms include linear regression, polynomial regression, and decision trees.  In machine learning, a loss function is a method of evaluating how well a specific algorithm models the given data. It is a mathematical function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The goal of the loss function is to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output, which is also known as the error.  The duality of model complexity in machine learning refers to the trade-off between the complexity of the model and its ability to generalize to new data. A more complex model can fit the training data better, but it may not perform well on new, unseen data due to overfitting. On the other hand, a simpler model may not fit the training data as well, but it may generalize better to new data. The goal of machine learning is to find the right balance between model complexity and generalization performance.  Metrics in machine learning are used to evaluate the performance of a model and measure how well it can make predictions on new, unseen data. The choice of metrics depends on the type of problem being solved and the specific goals of the project. For classification problems, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). For regression problems, common metrics include mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.  Linear regression is a machine learning algorithm that is used for predictive analysis and belongs to supervised learning. It is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the data. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.
