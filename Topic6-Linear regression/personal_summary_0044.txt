the fundamentals of the In this topics learnings we learned about supervised learnings and forms of supervised learnings. Regression problems, Classification problems and Ranking problems are the form of for supervised learnings. We also learned about supervised learning. Occam’s Razor, a famous problem-solving principle, is used as a heuristic guide in the development of theoretical models. razor. structure risks and it’s minimizations using the Occam’s classification problems are the most common type of machine learning applications. There are myriad metrics that can be used to evaluate predictions for Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve and F-1 Measure. One of the major concept of this topic’s learning was Regression Metrics. we learn about the problem solving of Regression Metrics it’s formate and mean square matrix. Another main concept we learned this topic was Partitioning data for training and testing. We usually work with 3 methods for splitting data: random subsampling, stratified sampling and cross validation. Each of these data splitting methods have their own specifications. We also learn the way to Finding the best hyperparameters. A hyperparameter is a value that is set before the learning process begins. Data cannot be used to estimate the value of a hyperparameter. They are used to estimate model parameters. this method is very much connected with dataset splitting into test and train data.machine learning can pose one of the following problems: datasets in which the total number of one class of data.Resultats that are negative (or worse).  To test the understanding of our concepts of this topic’s unit learning i took the quiz provided on the Deakin unit side. The screen shot of that quiz result is attached as under:
