This topic I learned about several topics related to supervised learning. The different forms of supervised learning, including regression and classification, and how to evaluate the performance of models using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared were discussed. Additionally, I explored the concept of model complexity and when a complex model should be used, along with the costs associated with using a complex model. I learned about the structural risk minimization and how it can be used to select an appropriate model complexity. Along with that, we examined the effect of imbalanced classes in classification problems and strategies to address this issue. Overall, this topic's studies provided a comprehensive understanding of supervised learning and its various aspects. Towards Data Science is a popular website that provides various articles and tutorials on machine learning, deep learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. I used this website for this topicâ€™s tasks as it had everything relating to the task along with being an excellent resource for learning new concepts and keeping up with the latest trends in the field.
