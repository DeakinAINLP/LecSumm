Topic 5 Learning Summary Report  Name: Viola Birech  Assignment: Task 5.1P  Institution: Deakin University  Date: 24/04/2023  1         Summary Report  Topic 5 Learning Summary  In topic 5 of our machine learning class, we covered a range of topics related to supervised  machine learning. It is a type of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled"  training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some  input data is already tagged with the correct output. In supervised learning, the training data provided  to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. It  applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher. Supervised learning is a  process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model. The aim  of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the  output variable(y). In the real-world, supervised learning can be used for Risk Assessment, Image  classification, Fraud Detection, spam filtering, etc.  We also explored the steps involved in supervised learning which include determining the  type of training data to Collect/Gather the labelled training data. Split the training dataset into training  dataset, test dataset, and validation dataset. Determine the input features of the training dataset, which  should have enough knowledge so that the model can accurately predict the output. Determine the  suitable algorithm for the model, such as support vector machine, decision tree, etc. Execute the  algorithm on the training dataset. Sometimes we need validation sets as the control parameters, which  are the subset of training datasets. Evaluate the accuracy of the model by providing the test set. If the  model predicts the correct output, which means our model is accurate.  Reflection  During topic 5 of my machine learning class, I studied various topics related to clustering. I  learned about how the default, after you have defined the data sources for a mining structure, the Data  Mining Wizard will divide the data into two sets: one with 70 percent of the source data, for training  the model, and one with 30 percent of the source data, for testing the model. This default was chosen  because a 70-30 ratio is often used in data mining, but with SQL Server Analysis Services you can  change this ratio to suit your requirements.  2   Overall, I found the topic 5 topics very informative and relevant to the field of machine  learning. I look forward to applying these techniques in practical projects and experiments.  Summary of Reading List  The fifth section of the machine learning course incorporated a range of resources for  utilization which were all like the previous topicsâ€™ resources. I found these resources very helpful to  my understanding of the content studied. These readings consist of textbooks such as, Hands-On  Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow and Python Machine Learning  Other additional resources are the various code libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and  scikit-learn which can be heavily utilized to learn and practicalize the lessons learnt. Research papers  and articles from journals are also crucial resources to enhance investigation on current research areas  in the field of machine learning. Online platforms like Kaggle and Data Camp are also critical in  utilization as supplementary materials for practice exercises and tutorials.  Quiz Score  3
