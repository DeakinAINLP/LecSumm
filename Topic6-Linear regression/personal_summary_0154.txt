Summary  of  the main  points  covered  in  topic 5 of  a course or program  on supervised  learning:    Distinguishing  between  supervised  and uncontrolled  learning.   Predicting  the performance  of  various  supervised  learning  algorithms.   Model  selection  and computation  of pertinent  assessment  measures.   Recognising  model  complexity  and knowing  when  to employ  complicated  models.   Understanding  the  costs of employing  sophisticated  models.    Thinking  about future  actions  after  reflecting  on what  was learnt  this  topic  Investigating  and learning  how  to utilise  Python  supervised  learning  packages.  2. Different  articles  as well  as slides  from  the course  are used to prepare this  topic learning.  In  topic  5, I most  certainly  developed  a better  knowledge  of  supervised  learning,  the  most  often utilised  technique  in  actual  machine  learning.  I learnt  how  to estimate  the  performance  of various supervised  learning  models,  how  to implement  model  selection,  and how  to compute  appropriate evaluation  metrics.  I  also  learned  about  model  complexity,  when  to utilise  complicated  models, and the  expenses  associated  with  them.  Furthermore,  I learned  about Scikit-Learn  and TensorFlow,  two Python  packages and libraries  for implementing  and evaluating  supervised  learning  models.  Finally,  I had the  opportunity  to reflect on what  I had  learned  and plan  my  next  steps.  Overall,  the  information  obtained  in  topic  5 may  serve  as  a solid  basis  for  developing  machine learning  models,  assessing  their  performance,  and  choosing  the  best models  for  a particular  issue.
