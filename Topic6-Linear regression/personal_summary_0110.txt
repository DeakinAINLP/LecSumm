Topic summary  -  This module was about understanding the fundamentals of supervised learning  including topics like model complexity, assessment, and selection. Key action points are mentioned below.  o  differentiate supervised learning from unsupervised learning  o  estimate the performance of different supervised learning models  o  implement model selection and compute relevant evaluation measures  -  Linear regression and evaluaiton  -  Learned about over and under fitting,  Classification metrics (ROC curve, conf matrix), regression specific metrics (MSE,R2)  -  Trian test data split , various methods of splitting data like cross validation or  random sampling and differences between the methods  -  Hyper parameters , uses and how to find best one  -  Model complexity and how it effects final outcomes
