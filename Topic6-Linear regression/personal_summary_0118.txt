In this topic had explored the supervised learning different forms, model complexity, struct risk minimization and data partitioning. Supervised learning is the data already labelled and try to find a function that can map the features or input data to the class. Confusion metrics is used to evaluate the performance of the classification model. By using the confusion metrics can find the true positive false negative. If the actual value was positive the model is also predict the positive values. Accuracy is not always the best metrics.
