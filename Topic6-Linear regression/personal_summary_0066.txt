This topic we learned about the fundamentals of supervised learning, which is a type of machine learning in which the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that the data is already categorized or classified. The goal for supervised learning is to build a model that can predict the label of unseen/new data. We also learnt about the complexity of models and when which one should be used, how complex a model should be, and what the costs of using it are.  We saw a bunch of new python packages for supervised learning and learnt about their applications in real world problems. I wasnâ€™t aware of how important finding the right hyperparameters is to get relevant results with the model.
