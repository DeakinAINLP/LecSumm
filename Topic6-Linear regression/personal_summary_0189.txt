Topic 5 Learning Summary This module covers the fundamentals of supervised machine learning, with emphasis on model complexity, assessment, and selection. Supervised learning employs labelled data to train an algorithm to predict output variables from input variables while unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data to identify hidden patterns or groupings within data.  Model complexity refers to the degree of difficulty or simplicity associated with a model. Simple models contain fewer parameters and are less likely to overfit training data, while complex ones contain multiple parameters and could be overfitted by fitting too closely to it and failing to generalize to new data sources. Overfitting occurs when models fit too closely to their training data without generalizing well across other datasets.  Model Assessment refers to the process of evaluating a trained model's performance on new data. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) can be used as measures of its success; this can be accomplished either through breaking up available data into training and testing sets or cross-validation techniques.  Model selection involves choosing the optimal model from among several candidate models that have performed well on new data, either through comparison of their evaluation metrics or employing techniques such as grid search or random search.  Key Concepts Linear regression:  Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between one or more dependent variables and multiple independent variables, in order to find a linear relationship and use this to make predictions about them.  Gradient Descent:  Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm commonly employed in machine learning to reduce cost functions of models, typically by iteratively adjusting parameters in a steepest- descent-initiating fashion until reaching minimum cost function value.  Closed Form Solution for Linear Regression: A closed form solution for linear regression is an equation which specifies optimal values for model parameters (intercept and slope) to minimize cost functions. It does this by taking the inverse of the product between transposed feature matrix and target variable and multiplying it with inverse product.  Evaluation Metrics: mes To assess the performance of a linear regression model, metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squared are used as measures of success. These metrics measure how well it fits data and its predictions as accurately.  Data Splitting:  To develop and assess a linear regression model, data is typically split into training and testing sets. The training set serves to train the model while testing provides feedback about its performance on new data that haven't yet been seen by its creators. This helps prevent overfitting while giving a more accurate depiction of its capabilities for handling unknown situations.  Sci-kit Learn:  Sci-kit Learn is a popular machine learning library in Python that provides tools for data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation. It includes built-in classes for linear regression and provides a straightforward interface for training and assessing linear regression models.
