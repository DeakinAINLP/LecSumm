We have covered the basics of supervised learning this topic. I have learned about regression and classification problems, hypothesis space, how learning algorithms seek a function, and what loss function, and structural and empirical risks are. I have also learned about complexity and overfitting and how they affect a machine learning model. I have read the blog post about Occam’s razor and understood the idea. I have understood the idea of structural risk and learned the formula behind it. I have learned about classification metrics such as confusion matrix, true & false positives & negatives, receiver operating characteristics curve, and F1 measure, regression metrics and performance measurement techniques such as MSE and r square, partitioning techniques for training and testing including subsampling, stratified sampling, and cross-validation, the importance of hyperparameters, how to find the best hyperparameter values using training and validation sets and different kinds of search strategies like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization with their efficiencies and effects of imbalanced class distribution. I have read through the programming part of the topic 5 learning resources and watched both the online class and the workshop recordings. I have studied some of the main ideas by using Udemy.
