 This topic's topics covered in machine learning include supervised learning algorithms, model complexity, data partitioning schemes, finding the best hyperparameters, and imbalanced class distribution.  Supervised learning makes use of labelled data to train models, and there are several types  of  supervised  learning  algorithms,  such  as  classification  and  regression.  The capacity of a model to match the data is referred to as its complexity, and Occam's razor  argues  that  simpler  models  are  preferable  than  complicated  ones.  Model complexity and accuracy may be balanced via structural risk minimisation.  Splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets is a data partitioning technique, and  the  ideal  hyperparameters  for  a  model  may  be  identified  by  modifying  and assessing performance on  the validation  set.  Imbalanced  class distribution happens when the amount of data in each class is uneven, which can lead to biased models. To correct uneven class distribution, techniques such as oversampling, under sampling, and class weighting can be applied.
