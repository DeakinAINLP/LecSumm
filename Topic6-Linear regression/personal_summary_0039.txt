I confirm that I have successfully achieved the below-mentioned learning goals.  1.  differentiate supervised learning from unsupervised learning. 2.  estimate the performance of different supervised learning models. 3.  implement model selection and compute relevant evaluation measures.  I was not familiar with any of these concepts at all. So, it was very interesting and exciting to learn about a new side of machine learning. And the practical part done with Python was new to me as well. Once I read through the theory, watched the attached videos and the lecture and some resources from the internet, I was able to grasp the theories well.
