Supervised learning is a type of machine learning technique in which an algorithm learns to map  inputs  to  outputs  based  on  a  set  of  labelled  examples  [1].  Supervised  learning  can  be regression,  classification  or  ranking  problems.  Objective  of  the  algorithm  is  to  find  a function(h)  than  can  map  a  relationship  between  X  to  y  accurately.  The  accuracy  of  the relationship is measured using loss function and empirical risk. However, care should be taken not to overfit the data as it can affect the prediction.  Confusion matrix can be used to evaluate the ML model for classification problems whereas the  regression  problems  are  evaluated  using  MSE  and  explained  variance.  To  evaluate  the model  data  must  be  partitioned.  It  is  usually  accomplished  using  random  subsampling, stratified sampling and cross validation. Validation set in addition to training and test dataset can be used to tune the hyperparameters. Imbalance  in  data  can  be  overcome  by  re-sampling  at  the  data  level  or  adjusting  at  the algorithmic level.
