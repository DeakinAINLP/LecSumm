This topic's machine learning topics include building models for classification and regression tasks using supervised learning techniques that rely on labelled data. Simplier models are prefered over complex ones, and model complexity, which relates to the model's capacity to match the data, is a crucial aspect. Model accuracy and complexity can be balanced with the aid of strategies like structural risk minimisation. To assure model performance on unknown data, data partitioning systems divide data into training, validation, and testing sets. By making changes to a model and analysing its performance on the validation set, the best hyperparameters for that model can be found. Biassed models may result from an unbalanced class distribution, where data are distributed differently among various classes. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, and class weighting can be used to overcome this.
