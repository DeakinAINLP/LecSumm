The main points that were covered this topic revolve around a general introduction to supervised learning and some common algorithms that are involved with supervised learning. For example, we covered the basics of regression vs classification, and things we must consider when implementing supervised learning such as not utilizing things that would not be known at prediction time. Topics such as model complexity, evaluating model performance, and considerations such as hyperparameters were also covered, which should all be considered when implementing supervised learning.
