Forms of supervised learning Regression problems  Linear Regression (linear model) Logistic Regression (linear model)  Classification problems  Support Vector Machines (both linear and nonlinear) Decision Trees (nonlinear) Random Forest (nonlinear) Neural Networks: Perceptron and Multi-layer Perceptron (nonlinear)  Ranking problems  Supervised learning algorithm Hypothesis space is a range of possible functions Hypothesis function is one of the functions in the hypothesis space Loss function is a measure of accuracy Empirical risk function reduces risk by picking function that achieves minimal risk  Occamâ€™s razor Problem-solving principle when multiple competing theories are equal in other respects, the principle recommends selecting the theory that introduces the fewest assumptions and has the least complexity  Structural risk minimisation Seeks to prevent over-fitting by incorporating a penalty on the model complexity that prefers simpler functions over more complex ones.
