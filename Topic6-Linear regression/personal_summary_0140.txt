 The Main points that I’ve covered in the fifth topic are as follows:  ➢  I got the knowledge of supervised learning and its majority of practical Machine learning. ➢  I have also understood the complexity of model and when it has to be used and what are the  consequences of using a complex model.  ➢  I have studies about the different types of classification metrics such as Confusion matrix,  ROC curve, F-1 Measure and Regression metrics etc.  ➢  Partitioning of data for training and testing  My Learning summary Based on 5th Topics Lecture was about Supervised Machine learning and exploring the Python packages such as Linear regression and other scikit learn packages. The best part in this topic was splitting the data into training data and testing data. For an accurate output mostly, we use 70% of training data and 30% of testing data. And I have learned different metrics such as Mean squared error and Root mean squared error and Cross Validation which I have implemented in my Ontrack task 5.1  Knowledge gained with Lecture slides.  In the Overall topic 5 I have gained the Knowledge of understanding the concepts of evaluating in Machine learning models and splitting the data and fitting the best regression line to a desired algorithm to predict the output. To evaluate our models by hyperparameter tuning and finding the best hyperparameter and improvising the quality of data.  Hence the Topic five was very useful and interesting by understanding the concept of Supervised Machine learning and regression analysis.
