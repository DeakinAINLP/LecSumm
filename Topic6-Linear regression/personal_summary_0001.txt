Supervised learning is a popular type of machine learning that involves training models on labelled data. It comes in different forms, including classification, which predicts a categorical variable, and regression, which predicts a continuous variable. To train these models, supervised learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks are commonly used. However, to ensure the model is accurate and generalizes well to new data, model complexity needs to be carefully managed through techniques such as structural risk minimization. Additionally, classification metrics and regression metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model, while hyperparameters can be fine-tuned to optimize performance. Imbalanced classes can also be a challenge, and regression error should be minimized to ensure the model is accurately predicting the target variable.
