The main points covered this topic covered the Supervised learning vs unsupervised learning.  The two types of unsupervised learning are Clustering and Association. Clustering involves grouping the data into clusters such that objects with most similarities remains into a group and has less or no similarities with the objects of another group.  Cluster analysis ﬁnds the commonalities between the data objects and categorizes them as per the presence and absence of those commonalities.  Association is used for ﬁnding the relationships between variables in the large database. It determines the set of items that occurs together in the dataset.
