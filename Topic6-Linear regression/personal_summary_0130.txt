 The emphasis this topic was on the principles of supervised learning, which included several types of problems such as regression and classification. We explored the complexities of models, analyzing the cost-benefit of adopting complicated models, and examined decision-making approaches for model selection such as Occam's razor and structural risk minimisation. We reviewed numerous matrices, such as classification and regression matrices, in order to evaluate models. We also discussed several data sampling approaches, such as random subsampling, stratified sampling, and cross-validation, which are critical for evaluating model performance and avoiding overfitting. Furthermore, we learnt strategies for finding the optimum hyperparameters, as well as how to deal with imbalanced data in classification issues, such as oversampling and undersampling.We have obtained essential knowledge and skills for creating and assessing successful machine learning models by the end of the topic.
