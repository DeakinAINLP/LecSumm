Summarise the main points that is covered in this topic.  a) The majority of practical machine learning applications use  supervised learning, in which the data used to train the  algorithm is labeled  b) The supervised learning is the task of estmating a function  from labelled training data, which is an advantage over  unsupervised learning b/c we know what we are going to  get  c) The loss function, measuring the difference between fit  values and true values, is to measure how accurately h  function describe the relationship between X to the target Y  d) The empirical risk is calculated by averaging the results of  the loss function
