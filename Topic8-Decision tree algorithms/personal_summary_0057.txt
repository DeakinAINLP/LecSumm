Topic 7 Summary SVM Models  Applications:  Face detection  Classification of images  Biometrics Supervised learning: Machine learning model learns from past input data, makes future  prediction as output  Draws hyperplane (line in 2d, plane in 3d) Distance between support vector and hyperplane should be maximised  Vapnikâ€“Chervonenkis theory  Shattering (characterising complexity of hypothesis class)  VC dimension: number of instances hypothesis class can shatter  VC dimension of a line in 2d is 3 data points
