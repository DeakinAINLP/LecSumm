In  ½-¾  page,  identify  the  most  important lessons/topics this topic relevant to your future studies/career and explain why they are the most important. Note: Do not present/explain topics, you are explaining why the things you learned are important! Last  topic,  I  learned  various  essential  Kubernetes  topics  that  are  crucial  in  managing containerized applications. The topic of Labels and Selectors is important as they enable grouping and management of Kubernetes resources like Services, ReplicaSets, and Pods based on various criteria. The vast range of Kubernetes operations that can be applied based on labels both within and across the hierarchy were interesting to learn about.  Another important topic that was Namespaces, which provide a common mechanism for dividing Kubernetes objects like Pods and Services. Namespaces  proved to be useful in managing resources in a complex environment with multiple users, teams, and projects and help prevent naming conflicts between objects.  Furthermore,  DaemonSets,  which  are  similar  to  ReplicaSets  in  functionality,  but  with differences  in  scheduling.  I  learned  that  there  are  alternatives  to  DaemonSets  like  Init scripts, Bare Pods, and Static Pods.  Lastly, Jobs and CronJobs and how they can be used to schedule tasks in Kubernetes. I found it crucial to recognize that the start time of a Kubernetes CronJob is approximate, unlike Unix cron jobs, and resources are reserved in the system when a Pod that is part of a Job terminates.  Overall, I found these topics to be informative and important for managing containerized applications in Kubernetes.
