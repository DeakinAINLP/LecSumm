This topic we learnt about SVMs ( Support Vector Machines ) and why they’re so popular as a machine learning algorithm. The key idea behind SVMs is to identify the “support vectors”, which are the data points closest to the hyperplane, and use them to maximize the margin between the two classes. In addition to linear hyperplanes, SVMs can also use non-linear functions known as kernels to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where the classes may be more separable. They have a wide range of uses including image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics. One of the advantages of SVMs is that they are less prone to overfitting than some other machine learning algorithms.
