TOPIC 7: SVM MODELS  Concept of SVM formulation and solution for linearly separable  ● data.  Understanding on how vector support machine works as well as  ● examples in python.  SVM formulation and solution for linearly non-separable data, by  ● combining the soft margin (tolerance of misclassifications) and kernel trick together, support vector machine is able to structure the decision boundary for linear non-separable cases.  Kernel trick and non-linear SVN, kernel trick is used in Support  ● Vector Machine (SVM) model to bridge linearity and non-linearity. It converts non-linear lower dimension space to a higher dimension space thereby we can get a linear classification.  Learning to build a support vector regression (SVR) model in  ● machine learning and analysis of the results.  The statistical learning theory of SVM, structural risk minimisation  ● seeking to prevent over fitting by incorporating a penalty on the model complexity.  Concept of multi-class classification in SVM, in this type, the  ● machine should classify an instance as only one of three classes or more.  Understanding SVM in python as well as using linear kernel with  ● the default parameters.  Expounding SVM in python, polynomial kernel and regularisation  ● with SVM.  ●  Concept of SVM in python that is RBF kernel.
