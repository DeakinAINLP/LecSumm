 Main points of this module:    SMV formulation aims to solve the ‘optimisation problem’, by aiming to find a hyperplane so  that the margin is maximised while satisfying the constraint.    Noisy data is not linearly separable, it has interference.   Soft margin dual problem refers to a change in the primal problem with soft margins to dual.   Structural risk minimisation seeks to prevent over-fitting via a model complexity penalty,  and therefore prefers functions of simplicity.    To minimise the probabilistic guarantee, you can either first increase the number of training  sets or minimise the complexity of the model.    Multi-class classification in SMV can be performed in either one vs all, or one vs one.   One vs all involves training a binary SVM classifier, for each class, with samples from that class being viewed as positive examples and any other classes being viewed as negative.   One vs one involves training multiple binary SMV classifiers, each trained to distinguish  between two classes.  Provide a summary of your reading list:  I just followed the given study material (7.1 – 7.11), reading everything until I understood it confidently, as well as viewing any linked videos provided. This topic I actually didn’t end up needing to spend that much time on the problem-solving activity. The first question was quite similar to a question in a previous problem-solving activity, so I only had to modify my old work.
