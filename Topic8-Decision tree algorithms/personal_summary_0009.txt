This topic's topics included support vector machines (SVMs), a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs are particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, and they work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into different classes. I learned about the formulation and solution of SVMs for linearly separable data along with how SVMs can be extended to handle linearly non-separable data using the kernel trick, which involves mapping the data to a higher -dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. Unit content also discussed support vector regression, which is a variant of SVMs that can be used for regression tasks. Learning resources also covered the statistical learning theory of SVMs, which provides a theoretical framework for understanding the algorithm's performance and generalization properties. I also learned about multi-class classification in SVMs and how it can be achieved using a variety of strategies, such as one-vs-one and one-vs-all. Finally, we implemented SVMs in Python using different kernels, including linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF). We also evaluated the performance of SVMs using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Based on the topics covered this topic, I have gained a deeper understanding of support vector machines (SVMs) and their applications in machine learning. Specifically, I have learned about the formulation and solution of SVMs for both linearly separable and non-separable data, as well as the use of the kernel trick to extend SVMs to handle non-separable data. I have also learned about support vector regression, multi-class classification in SVMs, and the statistical learning theory of SVMs. In addition to theoretical concepts, I have also gained practical experience in implementing SVMs in Python using different kernels and evaluating their performance using  various metrics. Overall, this topic's content has provided me with a solid foundation in SVMs and their applications, which I believe will be useful in future machine learning projects.
