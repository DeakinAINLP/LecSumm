The focus of Topic 6 was on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). SVMs are a popular supervised learning algorithm used in classification and regression analysis. SVMs work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the two classes in a linearly separable dataset. SVMs can also be used to handle non- linearly separable data by transforming the input space using the kernel trick.  We began by discussing the SVM formulation and solution for linearly separable data. The goal of SVM is to find the maximum margin hyperplane that separates two classes in a dataset. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from both classes. The optimal hyperplane is found by minimizing the margin subject to the constraint that all data points are correctly classified.  Next, we covered the SVM formulation and solution for linearly non-separable data. In real-world problems, it is often the case that data cannot be separated by a hyperplane. In such cases, SVMs introduce a slack variable that allows some misclassifications. The objective of SVM is to minimize the sum of the slack variables and the margin subject to the constraint that all data points are classified correctly as much as possible.  We then delved into the kernel trick and non-linear SVM. The kernel trick is a technique used to transform the input space into a higher-dimensional space where the data is linearly separable. A kernel function is used to compute the dot product between two transformed feature vectors in the higher-dimensional space. Common kernel functions include the polynomial kernel, Gaussian RBF kernel, and sigmoid kernel.  Next, we covered Support Vector Regression (SVR). SVR is a type of SVM used in regression problems. In SVR, the goal is to find a hyperplane that captures as many data points as possible within a certain distance (epsilon) while also minimizing the magnitude of the model weights.  The topic also introduced the Statistical Learning Theory of SVM. The Statistical Learning Theory provides a theoretical basis for understanding the performance of SVMs. It defines the concept of the structural risk minimization principle and the empirical risk minimization principle.  Finally, we covered SVM in Python using the Scikit-learn library. The course demonstrated how to implement SVMs with different kernels (linear, polynomial, and RBF) using the Scikit-learn library in Python. We also discussed multi-class classification in SVM, where SVM is used to classify data into more than two classes.  In summary, we covered the theory and application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), including SVM formulation and solution for linearly separable and non- separable data, the kernel trick, Support Vector Regression (SVR), the Statistical Learning Theory of SVM, and SVM in Python using the Scikit-learn library.
