Main points summary  Linear SVM / Non-linear SVM.  - -  Dual optimisation problem. The dual problem's solution establishes a lower  - bound for the primal (minimisation) problem's solution. The primal problem in SVM which is maximising the margin. Linearly non-separable data. Sometimes data is linearly separable, but only by a small margin. Other times, noise may prevent some of the instances from being linearly separable.  -  The soft margin concept. Slack variables are added to allow misclassification of  outliers, noisy or difficult to classify instances.  -  The number of instances a hypothesis class can shatter is called its Vapnik-  Chervonenkis (VC) Dimension.  -  SVM in Python
