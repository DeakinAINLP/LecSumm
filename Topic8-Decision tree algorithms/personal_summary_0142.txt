This topic's main points cover various aspects of Support Vector Machines (SVM),  including the formulation and solution for both linearly separable and non-separable data, kernel trick and non-linear SVM, support vector regression, statistical learning theory of SVM, multi-class classiÔ¨Åcation in SVM, and the implementation of SVM in Python using linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels.
