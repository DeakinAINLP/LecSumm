Topic 7 Learning Summary Report  Name: Viola Birech  Assignment: Task 7.1P  Institution: Deakin University  Date: 12/05/2023  1         Summary Report  Topic 7 Learning Summary  In topic 7 of our machine learning class, we covered a range of topics related to the SVM  model. It is the formulation of a hyperplane and can be a linear SVM or a non-linear SVM. Its  optimization problem is the primal problem in SVM which is maximising the margin (or  minimising 1/margin. The soft margin dual problem is defined when we change the primal  problem with soft margins to dual. It remains the same except that there is an upper bound on the  Lagrange multipliers. We also explored the boundaries of noisy data points or outliers.  Reflection  During topic 7 of my machine learning class, I studied various topics related to SVM. I  learned about how the one vs one is the soft margin dual problem is defined when we change  the primal problem with soft margins to dual. It remains the same except that there is an upper  bound on the Lagrange multipliers. Also, the idea behind OvR (SVM one vs rest) is to train one  binary classifier for each class, where the positive examples are from that class and the negative  examples are from all other classes combined. Overall, I found the topic 7 topics very informative and  relevant to the field of machine learning. I look forward to applying these techniques in practical  projects and experiments.  Summary of Reading List  The seventh section of the machine learning course incorporated a range of resources for  utilization which were all like the previous topicsâ€™ resources. I found these resources very helpful to  my understanding of the content studied. These readings consist of textbooks such as, Hands-On  Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow and Python Machine Learning  Other additional resources are the various code libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and  scikit-learn which can be heavily utilized to learn and practicalize the lessons learnt. Research papers  and articles from journals are also crucial resources to enhance investigation on current research areas  in the field of machine learning. Online platforms like Kaggle and Data Camp are also critical in  utilization as supplementary materials for practice exercises and tutorials.  2    Quiz Score  3
