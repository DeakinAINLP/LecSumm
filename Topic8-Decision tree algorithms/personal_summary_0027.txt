Support Vector Machine: supervised machine learning model used for classification and regression. SVM aim to find a line (in 2D) or hyperplane (in high dimensional) to maximize the margin  Soft Margin: trade-offs between margin and the number of errors when doing classification.  Kernel trick: techniques to transform low-dimensional dataset which is unable to do linear classification into high-dimensional which can be classified using a hyperplane.  - Linear -  Polynomial -  Radial basis function (RBF)  Multi-class classification in SVM:  -  One vs one: train multiple pairs of classes by using multiple binary classifiers. The class  selected based on the maximum number of classifiers.  -  One vs All: train one class with the rest of other classes. The class with highest score  would be chosen.
