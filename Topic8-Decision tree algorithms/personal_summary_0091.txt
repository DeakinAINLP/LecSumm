Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Type of Supervised learning algorithm)  ● Detect classification and regression ● The idea of SVM is to find a line / hyperplane that separates the data points into different  classes with the max margin  ● Line (straight line): Used for 2D data ● Hyperplane: For other higher dimension  SVM Formulation: Find hyperplane that is separating the 2 classes with the max margin as much as possible  Kernel Tricks  ● Kernel tricks is used in some situations where the data may not be able to separate linearly therefore it also means hyperplanes may not be used in order to separate the classes ● The kernel trick converts the starting point of input space into a higher-dimensional space with a hyperplane that can divide the classes. The input data points are transformed by applying a kernel function into them  ● Kernel tricks are used to map the two data points to a higher dimensional space and  determine the similarity if the two data points are in the original input space  ● Using a kernel approach, we are also able to apply SVM to identify a solution for nonlinearly  separable data  An Illustration of VC Dimension  ● Measuring binary classifier's ability to recognise patterns in data and help analysis the  generalisation error of ML algorithm  ● It reveals the degree to which a classifier can be use in order to adjust new information  without overfitting or underfitting  The Probabilistic Guarantee  ● Provides a measurement for the generalisation performance of the SVM on new data ● Equation below is used in order to measure the quantity of a learning algorithm in terms of  error rate on the new unseen / untested data  ● The equation provides an unique upper bound on the difference between the actual error  rate seen on the training data and the predicted error rate on new data  Multi class classification in SVM  ● One VS All: SVM creates a special binary classifier for every class that competes with all the  other multi-class classification  ● One VS One: SVM creates a special binary classifier for every pair of other multi-class  classification
