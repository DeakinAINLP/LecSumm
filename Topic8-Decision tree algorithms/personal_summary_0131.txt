The main points that were covered this topic were about support vector models and the various types that exist. The main ones that were covered were linear, polynomial and RBF kernels. We learnt quite about various applications of SVM, and also had a lot of experience and opportunities to apply SVM ourselves and work out any quirks and issues that came along with it. We also delved into hyper-parameters and their effects on the results and model outcomes.
