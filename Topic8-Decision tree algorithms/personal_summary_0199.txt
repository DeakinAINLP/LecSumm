This module covered SVM and how it can be used as either a classiﬁer or for regression. SVM algorithms can use diﬀerent kernels such as RBF, polynomial and linear. The diﬀerent kernels change how the algorithm works and alters its classiﬁcation or regression outputs.  Reﬂection This topic’s tasks where not too bad though I did have some diﬃculty with the quiz until I went back and read through the information again. Which allowed me to understand where I went wrong with the questions for next time.
