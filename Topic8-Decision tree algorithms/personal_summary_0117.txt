In  this  topic  was  still  explored  supervised  learning.  But  in  specific  on  the  support  vector machine. The SVM formulation on linearly separable data and non-linearly separable data. The  concept  of  margin  on  the  SVM  is  maximise  the  margin  and  to  minimise  the  possible conflicts. SVM use kernel function to map the data. Kernel functions are included polynomial, linear and Radial basis function.
