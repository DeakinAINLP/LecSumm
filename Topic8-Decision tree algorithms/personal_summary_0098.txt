 SVM formulation and solution for linearly separable data: The SVM formulation therefore solves the following optimisation problem:  Summary  Dual optimisation problem:   SVM formulation and solution for linearly non-separable data: Sometimes, data can be linearly separable but with a narrow margin. At other times, due to noise, some of the instances may not be linearly separable. This trade-off brings us to the soft margin concept.  Soft margin dual problem:
