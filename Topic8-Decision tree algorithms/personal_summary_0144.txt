In topic  seven, we focused on the  concept  of Support Vector Machines (SVM), which is  a  popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. We started  by discussing the formulation and solution of SVM for linearly separable data, where we aim  to find a hyperplane that separates the two classes with the maximum margin. The margin is  defined  as  the  perpendicular  distance  between  the  hyperplane  and  the  closest  point  of  each  class. We also discussed the linear SVM dual optimization problem.  Next, we looked at the formulation and solution of SVM for linearly non-separable data, where  we also introduced the soft margin dual problem. We then discussed the concept of kernel trick,  which involves mapping the data into a higher-dimensional space where it is linearly separable.  The kernel function is used to calculate the dot product between the mapped data points without  explicitly computing the transformation, which can be computationally expensive.  We  also  explored  Support  Vector  Regression  (SVR),  which  is  used  to  solve  regression  problems using SVM. In addition, we concentrated on the statistical learning theory of SVM,  which is based on minimizing the upper bound of the generalization error. We discussed the  concept of margin-based loss, which measures the quality of a model based on the margin of  the hyperplane. We also explored what Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) Dimension means and an  illustration of VC dimension.  Furthermore, we looked at multi-class classification using SVM, where we can use either the  one-vs-one  or  one-vs-rest  approach.  In  the  one-vs-one  approach,  we  train  multiple  binary  classifiers for each pair of classes and use a voting scheme to determine the final prediction. In  the one-vs-rest approach, we train one classifier for each class and use the maximum decision  function value to determine the final prediction.  In the programming part of the unit, we had hands-on experience with SVM in Python using  different kernels, including the linear kernel, polynomial kernel, and RBF kernel. We explored  how to implement SVM models in Python using the Scikit-learn library, tune hyper parameters  using grid search, and evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix. We  also  discussed  the  importance  of  scaling  the  features  and  the  effect  of  different  hyper  parameters on the model performance.  Overall, SVM is a powerful algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression  problems. It works well for both linearly separable and non-separable data, and can handle non-  linear data using the kernel trick. SVM also has a strong theoretical foundation based on the  statistical learning theory, which provides a framework for understanding the generalization  performance of the model.
