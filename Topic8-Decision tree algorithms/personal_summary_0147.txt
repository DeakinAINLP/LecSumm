The main points covered in this topic are all about SVM formulation and solution for linearly separable data and non-separable data, kernel trick and non-linear SVM, support vector regression, statistical learning theory of SVM, multi-class classification in SVM. Then we started to implement SVM in python using linear kernel, polynomial kernel and RBF kernel.
