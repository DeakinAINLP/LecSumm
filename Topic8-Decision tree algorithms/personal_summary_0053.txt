During topic seven of the course, we focused on supervised learning, which mainly on Support Vector Machine(SVM). The lecture covered the importance of understanding hyperplane,  along  with  the  difference  between  hard  and  soft  margin  concepts  and how we can use it in multi-classification problems. It also delved into the difference between  logistic  regression  and  SVM  and  the  advantages  of  SVM.  We  also  learned about the sci-kit processes in Python, which can be used to implement SVM on train data  and  evaluation  on  test  data  and  use  of  different  kernels  to  get  the  get performance. Overall, the lecture provided a deep understanding of Support Vector Machine.
