1)Non-linear SVM is used for non-linearly separated data, which implies that if a dataset cannot be categorised using a straight line, it is non-linear data, and the classifier utilised is non-linear SVM classifier. 2)Support Vector Machine, sometimes known as SVM, is a linear model used to solve classification and regression issues. It is effective for many real-world issues and can handle both linear and non-linear problems. 3)The concept of duality, often known as the duality principle, states that optimisation issues may be seen from either the primal problem or the dual problem. 4)Soft edge By easing the strict restrictions of Support Vector Machine, SVM permits some misclassification to occur. The Regularisation parameter is used to implement Soft Margin SVM. 5) According to the linear hypothesis, a random observation's mean (average) may be expressed as a linear combination of a few observed predictor variables. 6)A paradigm for machine learning that integrates concepts from functional analysis and statistics is known as statistical learning theory. The statistical inference issue of identifying a prediction function from data is addressed by statistical learning theory. 7)To achieve mutual linear separation between every two classes, it is intended to map data points to high-dimensional space. This technique, known as a One-to-One strategy, divides the multiclass classification issue into several binary classification problems. One-vs-One is a different heuristic technique for multi-class binary classification algorithms. One-vs-one divides a multi-class classification dataset into binary classification tasks, just like one-vs-rest does.
