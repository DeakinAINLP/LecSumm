 The Main points that I’ve covered in the Seventh topic are as follows:  ➢  I have understood the concept of Support Vector Machine (SVM) ➢  The implementation of SVM on regression data. ➢  I got the knowledge of Statistical theory of SVM. ➢  I have understood the implementation of SVM using Python.  My Learning summary Based on 7th Topics Lecture was gaining Knowledge of different SVM techniques, As SVM is a Supervised Machine Learning algorithm, and it can be used for both regression and classification but mostly preferred for classification data. This algorithm produces significant accuracy compared to other classification algorithms such as logistic regression or decision trees. The Main intention of SVM algorithm is to find hyperplane in N-dimensional space where hyperplanes can be explained as a decision boundary that help classify the data points.  Knowledge gained with Lecture slides.  In the Overall topic 7 I have explored different SVM formulation and solutions for data and implemented dual optimisation techniques and further on studied about the Linear hypothesis and how to fit the line to data points using linear hypothesis. I have thoroughly grasped the knowledge of One vs One and One vs all Multi Class Classification and I have implemented these techniques in Jupyter notebook and plotted different histograms for iris dataset.  Hence the Topic Seven was very useful and interesting by understanding the concept of Support Vector Machines and I have implemented this algorithm with RBF kernel in task 7.1P.
