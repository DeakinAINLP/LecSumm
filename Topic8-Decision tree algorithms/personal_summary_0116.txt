 Topic 7 - SVM - Evernote  Topic 7 - SVM  SVM aims to find a hyperplane (w,b) so that the margin 2/|w| is maximised while satisfying the constraint  y(w(transpose)x + b) >=1  SVM formulation solves the optimisation problem,  Minimise 1/2|w|squared subject to y(w(transpose)x + b)>=1  Using Lagrange multipliers a constrained optimisation can be converted into an  unconstrained optimisation problem.  Lagrange multipliers is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to  equality constraints.  When the instances are not linearly separable, its generally preferred not to interfere with the boundary  with small noisy data or outliers. It is acceptable to have large margins even if some of the constraints are  violated.  Soft margin dual problem is defined when we change the primal problem with soft margins to dual. It remains the same except that there is an upper bound on the Lagrange multipliers.  Structural risk minimisation seeks to prevent over-fitting by incorporating a penalty on the model complexity which means it prefers simpler functions over more complex functions. If we pick n instances  and assign labels of + and - to them randomly, if our hypothesis class is rich enough to learn any association of labels to the data, it is sufficiently complex.  Maximising margins will result in having a less complex model.  Multi-class classification in SVM  One vs all : In this approach, a binary SVM classifier is trained with samples from that class being viewed as positive examples and samples from the other classes being viewed as negative  examples. One vs One : In this method, SVM algorithm trains multiple binary classifiers each trained to distinguish between two classes. During the prediction phase, each test sample is passed to all binary classifiers and a voting scheme is applied on the output of individual binary classifier  outputs to determine the final class label.  https://www.evernote.com/client/web?login=true#?n=6426c642-4afd-e407-80bc-0796482717a7&  1/2   Topic 7 - SVM - Evernote  https://www.evernote.com/client/web?login=true#?n=6426c642-4afd-e407-80bc-0796482717a7&  2/2
