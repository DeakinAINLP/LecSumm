Topicly Summary  The focus of this topic was Support Vector Machines  Support Vector Machines  Support Vector Machines are another form of supervised learning methodology which can be used for both classification and regression problems. Support Vector Machines work by mapping data to a higher dimensional space in order to separate data that cannot be separated linearly.  Hyperplane  The aim of SVM is to find a hyperplane which separates the data while maximising the distance between the different classes.  Support Vectors  Support Vectors are the data points from the different classes which are closest to the hyperplane and are used to determine the position and angle/orientation of the hyperplane. The hyperplane represents the decision boundary which determines which class an individual data point is classified as.  SVM Hyperparameters  C is used to control error in the model. Low values of C lead to low error levels, where higher levels of C allow higher error rates. While low error would lessen data points being incorrectly classified, a low error rate does not necessarily lead to a better model. For example an extreme outlier may skew the model greatly if the error rate is low.  Gamma is a hyperparameter specifically used by the RBF kernel to set how much curve is allowed in the decision boundary of the model. High values of gamma relate to more curvature, low values result in less curvature.
