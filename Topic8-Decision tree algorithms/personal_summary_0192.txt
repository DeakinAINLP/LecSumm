This topic we covered SVM model along with its implementation with various kernels, linear, RBF and polynomial in particular. In addition we also studied their python implementations.  Reading List We start with 7.1 which is an introduction to SVM and its 2 types linear and non-linear. Then from 7.2 to  7.4  we  studied  formulation  and  solution  for  linear  and  non-linearly  separable  data  plus  use  of kernels to handle non-linear data with high dimensions.  Furthermore, in 7.5 we  discussed  Support Vector Regression  followed by statistical learning theory behind SVM and concepts like empirical risk minimization and trade-off between bias and variance. Then 7.7 covers SVM for multi-class classification. At end, we studied python implementation of Linear, polynomial and RBF kernal from 7.8 to 7.10 respectively.
