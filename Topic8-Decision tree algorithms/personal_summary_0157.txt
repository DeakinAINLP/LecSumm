Main points of this topic include SVM for  linearly separable and non-separable data, regulazitation, polynomial kernel and RBF kernel. This information will be useful for utilising SVM to solve actual machine learning issues and comprehending its advantages and disadvantages. A supervised learning approach called SVR (Support Vector Regression) is applied to regression tasks. It is an expansion of the classification-focused Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique.In a manner similar to SVM, SVR seeks to identify a hyperplane that maximises the margin, but allows for error tolerance  as opposed to rigid classification limits. A kernel function is used to build the hyperplane in the feature space, a higher- dimensional space.
