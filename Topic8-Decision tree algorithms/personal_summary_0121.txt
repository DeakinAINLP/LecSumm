 In topic 7 of my Machine Learning course, I developed a thorough understanding of Support Vector  Machines  (SVM)  models,  which  are  potent  and  adaptable  supervised  learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. The information presented this topic shed vital light on several SVM model-related topics, including how to formulate and solve  them  for  linearly  and  nonlinearly  separable  data,  how  to  use  the  kernel  method, nonlinear SVM, how to use support vector regression, how to use multi-class classification, and how to use non-linear SVM. Applying SVM models to a variety of real-world issues and realizing their full potential requires these learnings.  The SVM formulation and solution for linearly separable data, where the algorithm aims to find the ideal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes, was the topic of our first  discussion  of  the  topic.  We  explored  the  dual  optimization  problem,  a  mathematical approach  for  maximizing  the  margin  and  minimizing  the  classification  error  in  the  SVM challenge.  We next looked at the SVM formulation and solution for linearly non-separable data, which includes adding a soft margin to account for certain misclassifications. With this improvement, SVM is strengthened and more suited for datasets from the actual world that might not be completely  separable.  The  soft  margin  dual  issue,  which  attempts  to  strike  a  compromise between increasing the margin and reducing classification mistakes, was introduced to us.  The Kernel Trick, which enables us to shift the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable, is a crucial component of SVM models. We looked at the idea of a non-linear SVM, which maps the input data to a higher-dimensional feature space where the linear hypothesis may be used.  SVM is extended to regression challenges using Support Vector Regression (SVR), where the objective is to predict continuous values rather than class labels. By minimizing the regression error  while  keeping  the  simplicity  of  the  model  and  fitting  a  hyperplane  within  a predetermined range around the genuine output values, we were able to understand how SVR operates.  The  Statistical  Learning  Theory  of  SVM,  which  offers  a  theoretical  framework  for comprehending the generalization capabilities of SVM models, was also presented over the topic. We talked about the idea of the VC Dimension, a crucial idea in this theory that assesses a learning algorithm's capability and explains the trade-off between model complexity and generalization.  Finally,  we  briefly  discussed  SVM's  multi-class  classification  framework,  which  uses  SVM's binary classification framework to address situations involving more than two classes. One- vs-All and One-vs-One, two common methods for multi-class categorization, were examined. While One-vs-One trains a binary classifier for each pair of classes, One-vs-All involves training multiple binary classifiers, one for each class. We may use SVM models for a wider range of classification issues by comprehending these methods.
