SVMs are sophisticated machine learning models that may be utilised for both classification and regression applications. In the case of linearly separable data, SVM identifies the hyperplane with the greatest margin that separates the two classes. When dealing with linearly non-separable data, however, SVM applies a method known as soft margin classification.  The formulation stays the same when employing SVM with non-linearly separable data, but the decision boundary is defined in the converted feature space. To identify the decision boundary, the optimisation algorithms locate the support vectors and appropriate weights.  Overall, SVM with slack variables and proper kernel functions is a flexible strategy for dealing with data that is both linearly non-separable and non-linearly separable.  The kernel trick is a technique used to manage non-linearly separable data in Support Vector Machines (SVMs). It enables SVMs to function implicitly in a higher-dimensional feature space without explicitly computing transformations. SVMs can identify a non-linear decision boundary in the original input space by employing the kernel approach.  SVMs enable non-linear decision boundaries while keeping the convex optimisation issue by utilising the kernel technique. SVM optimisation methods can solve the dual formulation effectively, identifying the support vectors and related weights for the decision boundary in the feature space.  Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a regression-oriented variation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). SVR extends the notion of SVMs to handle continuous target variables in regression situations, whereas SVMs are generally used for classification.  SVR seeks a function that approximates the mapping from the input characteristics to the continuous target variable while maximising the margin around the regression line. The margin denotes the range of acceptable deviations from the regression line.  The Statistical Learning Theory of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) provides a theoretical foundation for comprehending the concepts underlying SVMs as well as their generalisation performance. The idea is founded on the notions of structural and empirical risk minimisation.  SVMs were initially intended for binary classification issues in which the aim is to distinguish two classes using a hyperplane. SVMs, on the other hand, may be expanded to handle multi-class classification issues using two major approaches: one-vs-one (OvO) and one-vs-all (OvA).  Each pair of classes is trained a distinct binary SVM classifier in the OvO approach. N*(N-1)/2 classifiers are trained for N classes. Each binary classifier is trained to discriminate between a specific pair of classes during training. All binary classifiers are applied to the test instance to create predictions, and the class with the greatest votes is allocated as the predicted class. Because it needs training many classifiers, OvO is computationally costly for large numbers of classes.  In the OvA approach, a separate binary SVM classifier is trained for each class, with the positive class being the positive class and the remaining classes considered the negative class. Each binary classifier is trained to differentiate between one class and the others during training. Each binary classifier is applied to the test instance to produce predictions, and the class with the highest score is allocated as the anticipated class. OvA is more computationally efficient than OvO since it just requires training N binary classifiers for N classes.
