Topic7 summary Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM)  are  a  popular  class  of  supervised  learning  models  used  for classification and regression tasks. Here's a summary of the main points:  Margin  Maximization:  SVMs  aim  to  find  the  optimal  hyperplane  that  maximizes  the  margin between the two classes in the feature space. The margin is defined as the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from both classes, called support vectors.  Support Vectors: These are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary and have a direct impact on the position and orientation of the hyperplane. They are critical for determining the optimal hyperplane.  Linear Separability: In cases where the data is linearly separable, SVMs can find a hyperplane that perfectly separates the two classes. However, real-world data is often not linearly separable.  Kernel Trick: To handle non-linearly separable data, SVMs employ the kernel trick, which maps the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. Popular kernel functions include linear, polynomial, Gaussian (Radial Basis Function), and sigmoid kernels.  Regularization: SVMs use regularization to balance the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error. The regularization parameter, C, controls the trade-off: a smaller  C  creates  a  wider  margin  but  allows  more  misclassifications,  while  a  larger  C  creates a narrower margin with fewer misclassifications.  Multi-class Classification: Though SVMs are inherently binary classifiers, they can be extended to handle  multi-class  classification  problems  using  strategies  like  one-vs-one,  one-vs-rest,  or  using decision trees based on SVMs.  Applications: SVMs have been successfully applied to various domains, including text classification, image recognition, speech recognition, and bioinformatics.  Pros and Cons: SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces, robust against overfitting, and can handle non-linearly separable data using kernels. However, they can be sensitive to the choice of kernel and regularization parameter, require careful preprocessing and feature scaling, and may have high computational cost for large datasets.
