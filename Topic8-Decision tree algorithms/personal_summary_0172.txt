This topic I learned about support vector machines (SVM) and their role  in  developing  accurate  classifiers.  I  studied  the  suitability  of  SVM  in  various contexts,  the  potential  limitations  of the  approach,  and  how the  complexity  of  the  model  can  affect  the  results.  Moreover,  I  worked  on  implementing  several  Python  programs  to  apply  these  concepts  in  practical situations.
