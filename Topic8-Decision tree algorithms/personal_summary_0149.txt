Moving ahead with last topicâ€™s learning of linear and logistic learning, this topic we explored the concepts of linear and non linear SVM models.  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful and versatile supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs aim to find an optimal hyperplane in a high-dimensional feature space to separate different classes.  Linear SVM focuses on finding a linear hyperplane that can separate the classes in the original feature space, making it suitable for linearly separable datasets.  Non-linear SVM extends the linear approach by utilizing kernel functions to map the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable, allowing for handling non-linearly separable datasets.  In SVM, polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) kernels are two commonly used kernel functions for handling non-linearly separable datasets.  The polynomial kernel transforms the data into a higher-dimensional feature space using polynomial functions.  The RBF kernel, also known as the Gaussian kernel, maps the data into an infinite-dimensional feature space.  Both polynomial and RBF kernels offer a flexible and powerful way to handle non-linearly separable datasets in SVM. The choice between the two depends on the dataset characteristics and the desired complexity of the decision boundary. It is important to experiment with different kernel functions and tune their corresponding parameters to achieve the best performance for a given dataset.
