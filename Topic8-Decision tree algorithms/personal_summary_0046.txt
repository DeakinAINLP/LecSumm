This topic, we learned about Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in machine learning. We covered how SVMs work for both linearly separable and non-separable data, and how the kernel trick can be used for non-linear SVMs. We also learned about support vector regression, statistical learning theory of SVMs, and multi-class classification. We practiced implementing SVMs in Python using different kernels like linear, polynomial, and RBF.
