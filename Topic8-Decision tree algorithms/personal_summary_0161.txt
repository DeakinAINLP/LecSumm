This topic I got introduced to the concept of Support Vector Machines which is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used in classification. This is useful as it is applicable to high dimensioinal data and helps it segregates the data into classes by optimizing a hyperplane that best fits the datase.  In the context of hyperparameters used to tune the SVM performance, I learnt the various optimizations that can be implemented to create a better performing model including: - kernel type(rbf, linear or polynomial) - kernel parameters(C and gamma Parameters) - Regularization
