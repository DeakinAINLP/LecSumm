 In this module we learned about SVM which is also known as support virtual machine, SVM is mainly used for classification problems, SVM is a supervised learning method which sorts our data in two categories. SVM essentially works by creating a hyperplane between two sets of data points, it is called a hyperplane and not a line as it can be in higher dimensions as well and not just in 2 dimensions. SVM runs into a problem if it can’t segregate data points, as it can separate 3 distinct data points in 2 dimensions successfully but can’t do so in higher dimensions. So, a tradeoff needs to be made and that can be solved by using the parameter C. which decides if we want a high difference between the support vectors and the hyper plane. Then we learned about the SVM kernel and then we learned about the python implementation of SVM and how we can use the model with different kernels such as RBF, linear etc.
