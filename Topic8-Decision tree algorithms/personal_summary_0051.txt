 Summary  -  SVM stands for Support Vector Machine. The support vector machine algorithm  aims to find a hyperplane for the purpose of optimization.  -  Used for face detection, bioinformatics, text and hypertext categorization, image  classification.  Linear SVM  -  SVM is a supervised learning method that is used for classification to split the data in  -  the best possible way. It looks for the line that best splits the data. In Linear SVM, the distance between the support vector and the hyperplane should be as far as possible. The support vectors are closest to the most extreme points from each class. The Hyperplane should be as far away from the support vectors as possible. To use a support vector machine, we must have a 2 dimensional plane. If we have a 1 dimensional plane, we must have a clear separation between the two classes. If we don’t have this, we must use a kernel function to map the data onto a 2 dimensional plane.  -  “The kernel function will take the 1D input and transfer it to 2D output”  Non-Linear SVM  -  Linear SVM is not always appropriate in the dataset. When one class is surrounded by another class, the two cannot be separated by a straight line. In this case, we need to segregate the dataset by using a kernel function to add a third dimension.  SVM Parameters  -  The C parameter determines the penalty for misclassified datapoints. Reducing the C value increases the support vectors. “If we have a low C value, we get no regularization, a low penalty for misclassification. Hence we find a larger margin with more support vectors.”  -  P is the margin. Maximizing margin reduces the complexity of the model.
