The module for this topic introduced the SVM model, which is a linear classifier model like Logistic Regression, but it finds a hyperplane to separate groups by maximising the margin (or minimising the inverse of the margin). SVM has a concept called soft margin which allows data- points to be misclassified if they are outliers or noisy data-points. The model manages the impact of this soft margin through the hyperparameter C which penalises misclassification based on its value. SVM can also be used to separate groups with a polynomial boundary using a polynomial kernel, models using this kernel are more complex than linear ones and may suffer from overfitting if the data is not well suited and the hyperparameters C and gamma are not well managed.
