Support Vector Machines (SVM) can be used for classification and regression. Some examples of how SVM is used are facial detection, text and hypertext categorization, classification of images, and bioinformatics.  SVM formulation finds an optimal hyperplane (separating line) that separates data points into different classes. The SVM algorithm tries to find the boundary between classes by considering the points closest to the line. These points are the support vectors. The algorithm tried to maximize the distance between the support vectors and the line so the space between classes is as large as it can be. The distance between the support vector and the hyperplane should be as high as possible.  Benefits of SVD include:  Overcoming the curse of dimensionality Processing sparse document vectors And as a regularization parameter to prevent bias or overfitting.  Dual optimization is a way to solve the SVM algorithm. It finds set of numbers called Lagrange multipliers that represent the importance of each data point in the SVM model. The goal of dual optimization is to find the best values for each of the Lagrange multipliers and maximize the performance of the SVM model. The soft margin concept is a way of allowing flexibility in handling linearly non-  separable data points. It works by introducing a margin of tolerance for misclassified or overlapping data points using a parameter called C. C controls the tradeoff between the margin size and the number of misclassifications. A large C value allows for a narrower margin and fewer misclassifications making training data classifications more accurate. Smaller C creates a wider margin and allows more misclassifications which makes the model more generalizable. If the data points you are trying to classify donâ€™t already have some degree of separation and are mixed in with one another it becomes necessary to move away from a 1D view of the data to a 2D or 3D view of the data. A kernel function is used to transform the data.  Support Vector Regression (SVR) is used for regression tasks instead of classification tasks. SVR can predict continuous numerical values.  SVR aims to understand the relationship between input features and the corresponding continuous target values. This relationship is represented by a hyperplane, similar to SVMs, but in SVR, the hyperplane is used to define a range or margin around the data points. In SVR the hyperplane should minimize the distance between predicted and actual variables while ensuring error falls within a specified margin of tolerance. SVR aims to find the best fitting hyperplane that captures the general trend but also allows for some error. Like SVM, SVR uses support vectors (data points close to the margin). In SVR they help define the hyperplane and determine the regression model. Kernel functions are used in SVR to map input features to a higher-dimensional space where the data points become separable.  The statistical learning theory of SVM revolves around the idea of finding a good balance between fitting the training data well (without overfitting) and having good predictive performance on new, unseen data.  Multi-class classification in SVM is classifying data points into more than two classes using SVM algorithms. Multiclass classification in SVM can be done as one vs all or one vs one. In the one vs all approach a binary SVM classifier is trained with samples from that class being positive and samples from other classes being negative. During prediction, each classifier assigns a confidence score to its positive class, and the class with the highest score is chosen as the predicted class. One vs all is useful when you have many classes. In the one vs one approach the SVM algorithm trains multiple binary classifiers where each is trained to distinguish between two classes. During prediction, each classifier votes for its assigned class, and the class with the highest number of votes is selected as the predicted class. One vs one is useful when you have a moderate number of classes.
