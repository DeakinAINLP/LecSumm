 SVM is used to find a hyperplane in order to separate data    A soft margin is a concept where training data points are not linearly separable  A slack variable dictates how much misclassification is allowed  Data that is not linearly separable is projected into a higher dimension where a hyperplane  can separate the data   Kernels are used by SVM to go into higher dimensions  Examples of kernels used in SVM are RBF kernel, Linear kernal and polynomial kernel  I learned a lot of new things this topic. I learned about SVMs and why it is used. I learned about hyper planes and linearly and SVM kernels. The python module helped me learn how to use SVM to analyze datasets and how to use an RBF kernel.
