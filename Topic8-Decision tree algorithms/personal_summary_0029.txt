SVM formulation and solution for linearly separable data: SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification problems. It involves finding the  hyperplane  that  maximizes  the  margin  between  the  two  classes  of  data.  In  the  case  of linearly separable data, a hyperplane can be found that completely separates the data points of different classes. The SVM formulation involves finding the optimal weights and biases that define the maximum margin hyperplane.  SVM formulation and solution for linearly non-separable data: In  cases  where  the  data  may  not  be  linearly  separable,  the  SVM  formulation  and  solution involve the use of slack variables, which allow for some misclassification of data points. The optimization problem is then to minimize the sum of the slack variables while maximizing the margin. This is known as the soft margin SVM. The degree of misclassification is controlled by a regularization parameter, which balances the trade-off between the margin and the number of misclassified points.  Kernel trick and non-linear SVM: The  kernel  trick  is  a  technique  used  in  SVM  to  transform  the  input  features  into  a  higher dimensional space where the data becomes linearly separable. This allows SVM to be used for non-linear  classification  problems.  The  kernel  function  computes  the  inner  product  of  the transformed feature vectors in the higher dimensional space. The most commonly used kernel functions are the polynomial kernel and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel.  Statistical learning theory of SVM: The statistical learning theory of SVM is based on the principle of structural risk minimization. The  goal  is  to  find  the  maximum  margin  hyperplane  that  separates  the  data  points  while minimizing  the  generalization  error.  The  generalization  error  is  the  difference  between  the training error and the true error.  Multi-class classification in SVM: SVM can be used for multi-class classification by using a one-vs-all approach. Multiple binary classifiers  are  trained  for  each  class,  and  during  testing,  the  class  with  the  highest  score  is chosen as the predicted class.  SVM in Python - Linear kernel: The  scikit-learn  library  provides  an  SVM  implementation  in  Python  that  can  be  used  for linearly separable data. The linear kernel is specified using the 'linear' parameter.  SVM in Python - Polynomial kernel: The polynomial kernel can be used in SVM in Python for non-linear classification problems. The degree of the polynomial kernel can be specified using the 'degree' parameter.  SVM in Python - RBF kernel: The RBF kernel is another popular kernel used in SVM in Python for non-linear classification problems.  The  RBF  kernel  is  specified  using  the  'rbf'  parameter,  and  the  gamma  parameter controls the smoothness of the decision boundary.
