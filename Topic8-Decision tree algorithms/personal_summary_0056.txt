This topic we learnt about SVM’s or Support Vector Machines. SVM’s are useful for classification problems. It is a method of classifying data by generating a line that is as far away from points in either cluster. When generating this line, sometimes there has to be a level of acceptable error when classifying otherwise the line would be impossible. This is normally okay as long as most of the other data points are classified correctly.  If it is a 1-D or 2-D dataset that can not be split with a straight line, the data can be extended by a dimension so that a hyperplane can now be generated in the new space.  A note about SVM’s however is that with very large datasets or datasets with a lot of noise might be too computationally intense making SVM not a suitable classification model.  Reflection I had no idea what an SVM was until now but it seems like an extremely useful tool when it comes to classification. It can be used in applications such as image classification and text recognition.
