This topic, I studied SVM (Support Vector Machine) models. I watched the video that has been shown on 7.2 and understood what it is, where it stands in machine learning, and how I can use it in Python. I watched the video in 7.3 and understood what C is, how it is used while separating the classification, and how it separates the data while it takes different sizes. I consolidated my knowledge of linear regression and how it fits on data points and watched the videos in 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6. I learned about the VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) Dimension and concepts of one vs all / one vs one SVM classifications.
