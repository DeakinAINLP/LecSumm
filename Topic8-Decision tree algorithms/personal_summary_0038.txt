I confirm that I have successfully achieved the below-mentioned learning goals.  1.  SVM formulation and solution for linearly separable data. 2.  SVM formulation and solution for non-linearly separable data. 3.  Kernel trick and non-linear SVM. 4.  Statistical learning theory of SVM.  I had no prior knowledge of these concepts, so discovering them was really interesting and exciting, as it introduced me to a new facet of machine learning. Additionally, working with Python for the practical implementation of these concepts was a fresh experience for me. After studying the theory, watching the provided videos and lecture, and exploring additional online resources, I was able to comprehend the theories effectively.
