In topic seven of the unit SIT307, we focused on supervised learning, specifically on Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and regression analysis. The lecture covered the importance of understanding hyperplanes and how SVM can find the best hyperplane that maximizes the margin, and the distance between the closest data points from each class. We also learned the difference between hard and soft margin concepts and the advantages of using SVM over logistic regression in specific scenarios, such as handling high-dimensional data and being less susceptible to overfitting.  We also explored sci-kit processes in Python, in which we learned how to use sci-kit to implement SVM on train data, evaluate the performance on test data, and use different kernels like linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) to improve the performance of the SVM algorithm.  In summary, the lecture provided a profound comprehension of SVM and its applications in machine learning. By understanding hyperplanes, margins, and the differences between hard and soft margin concepts, we can apply SVM to various problems in classification and regression analysis. Using sci- kit processes in Python also offers a powerful tool for implementing and optimizing SVM models in practice.
