In this topic we studied Linear and non-linear SVM, its formulation and solution for linearly separable data, Kernel trick, linear hypothesis and formulation of linear regression, also we studied support vector regression, multi-class classification in SVM, Linear kernel, polynomial kernel and RBF kernel.  Support vector machine (SVM)  is used for classification  and regression tasks, It finds the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different class in a high-dimensional space. It tries to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the closest data points of different classes and called as maximum margin hyperplane. SVM can handle both linear and non-linear classification tasks using different types of kernels like linear, polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and can handle large number features, itâ€™s also less prone to overfitting.  Linear kernel is a simple and effective method for classification and regression tasks when the data is linearly separable, it computes the dot product of two vectors in the input space. The linear kernel is used when the data can be separated by a linear boundary, which means that the data points can be divided into two or more classes using a straight line or a hyperplane. It is preferred when the number of features is large compared to the number of samples, as it is computationally efficient and does not require a large amount of memory.  The polynomial kernel function is a non-linear function that can handle data that is not linearly separable. It maps the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space using a polynomial function. It is used when the data has a curved boundary that cannot be separated by a straight line or a hyperplane. The degree of the polynomial determines the complexity of the decision boundary, with higher degrees leading to more complex boundaries.  RBF kernel is a non-linear function that maps the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space. It is used when the data has a complex boundary that cannot be separated by a linear function or a polynomial function of a low degree. The RBF kernel can capture non-linear relationships between the input features, and its decision boundary is a smooth curve, it can handle data of any dimensionality, including high-dimensional data.
