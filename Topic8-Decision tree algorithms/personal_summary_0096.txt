 Support Vector Machines (SVM)    SVMs are supervised learning models primarily used for classification and regression.    They aim to find the hyperplane that maximally separates two classes of data points.    They use a subset of training points, called support vectors, to construct this optimal  hyperplane.    SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces, even when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.   Using SVMs for Both Linearly and Non-Linearly Separable Data      For linearly separable data, SVMs find the "maximum-margin" hyperplane that divides the data into two classes.  For non-linearly separable data, SVMs use a technique called the "kernel trick" to project the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable.    Popular kernels include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid.  Linear Regression    Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable (also called a dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (also called independent variables).    It assumes a linear relationship between the outcome and the predictor variables.    The goal is to find the line (in simple linear regression) or hyperplane (in multiple linear  regression) that best fits the data.        Support Vector Regression (SVR)    SVR is a regression version of SVM. Instead of trying to fit the largest possible margin between two classes while limiting margin violations, SVR tries to fit as many instances as possible within a margin while minimizing the violations.    Like SVMs, SVRs can use the kernel trick to handle non-linear relationships.  Statistical Learning of SVM    The learning of SVM involves solving a constrained quadratic optimization problem, which  ensures that the solution is a global minimum.    The dual problem of the optimization problem allows the implementation of the kernel trick.    The solution involves only the support vectors, and other training examples can be  discarded.                Multi-Classification in SVM (One vs All, One vs One)    SVMs inherently handle two-class problems. For multi-class problems, strategies such as "one-vs-all" (OvA) and "one-vs-one" (OvO) are used.    OvA strategy involves training a single classifier per class, with the samples of that class as  positive samples and all other samples as negatives. During testing, we select the class which classifies the test sample with highest confidence.    OvO strategy involves training classifiers for every pair of classes. During testing, we select  the class that is predicted most frequently by the classifiers.
