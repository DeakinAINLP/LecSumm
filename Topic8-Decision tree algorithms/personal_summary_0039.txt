SVM finds a hyperplane to maximize margin while satisfying constraints and uses quadratic programming to solve the optimization problem. The dual problem allows for nonlinear boundaries using kernels.  SVM uses soft margin concept and slack variables to handle non-linearly separable data, allowing some misclassifications while minimizing the sum of slack variables. The soft margin dual problem has an upper bound on Lagrange multipliers, and support vectors are used for classification.  Linear regression helps find a line to summarize and study relationships between two continuous variables. The line has two parameters, slope (w) and y-intercept (b), and the goal is to minimize the error between predicted and true values.  Linear regression helps predict statistics performance based on math aptitude scores. For example, a student with an 80 on the aptitude test is expected to score 78.288 in statistics.  VC dimension measures the complexity of a hypothesis class by how many instances it can shatter. Maximizing margins in SVM leads to less complex models, which helps minimize the generalization error. Increasing the training set size also reduces the generalization error.
