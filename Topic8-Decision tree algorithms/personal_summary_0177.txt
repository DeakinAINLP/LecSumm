Summarise the main points that is covered in this topic.    In the SVM with a linear kernel example, we scaled the data using StandardScaler and split it into training and testing sets using train_test_split.    We visualized the data before and after scaling using histograms.   We implemented SVM classification using the one-vs-rest (OvR) approach and the  one-vs-one (OvO) approach to handle multiclass classification.    We used the plot_decision_regions function from the mlxtend.plotting module to  visualize the decision boundaries.    We explored the effect of the regularization parameter C in SVM and observed how  changing its value affected the number of support vectors and the decision boundary.    We used LinearSVC from the svm module as an alternative implementation of SVM  with a linear kernel.    We demonstrated SVM classification with a polynomial kernel, where the degree of  the polynomial can be specified.    We observed the changes in the decision boundary and accuracy by varying the  degree of the polynomial kernel.    We prepared the code for using the RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel in SVM  classification.    We discussed the parameters C and gamma in the RBF kernel and their influence on  the decision surface and accuracy.    We applied the RBF kernel with different gamma values and observed the results in  terms of the decision boundary and accuracy.    We visualized the support vectors using the support_vectors_ attribute of the SVM  model.  Overall, we covered various aspects of SVM classification using different kernels (linear, polynomial, and RBF) and explored their effects on decision boundaries, accuracy, regularization, and support vectors.
