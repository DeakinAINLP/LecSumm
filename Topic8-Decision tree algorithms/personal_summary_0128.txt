In topic 7, the main topic that we looked at and learned about were Support Vector Machines or SVM. They are linear models for classification and regression problems. The idea of SVMs is to create a hyperplane to separate the data into classes. We explored the technique of how to use them, and under what circumstances you want to use them for. We went over different types of kernels that we could use in varying circumstances that best fit the given data. Along with this we covered One vs Rest and One vs One which are two methods that help binary classifiers such as SVM to work on multi-class classification problems.
