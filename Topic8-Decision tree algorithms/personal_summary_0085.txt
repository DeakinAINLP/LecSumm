 Space vector machines (SVM) work by finding a hyperplane that give the highest  separation of the classes. This hyperplane is found by finding the largest margin  between the two closest points from each class. SVMs are most useful for classification  problems. One of the parameters in SVM is the C value which a high C value aims for a  very precise hyperplane allowing for as little misclassifications as possible whereas a  low C value allows for a bigger margin which may allow for some misclassifications but  be more accurate overall.
