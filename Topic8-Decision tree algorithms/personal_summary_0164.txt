Topic 7 Learnings  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a class of powerful and flexible machine learning models that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. SVMs are particularly well-suited for handling high-dimensional data, as they are able to find a hyperplane that separates data points into different classes.  Linear SVMs are a type of SVM that use a linear decision boundary to separate classes. The goal of a linear SVM is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two  classes.  The  margin  is  the  distance  between  the  hyperplane  and  the  closest  data points  from  each  class,  and  the  SVM  tries  to  find  the  hyperplane  that  maximizes  this distance. The decision boundary is formed by the hyperplane, and any data points on one side of the hyperplane are classified as one class, while any data points on the other side are classified as the other class.  The  math  for  linear  SVMs  involves  finding  the  optimal  hyperplane  that  maximizes  the margin. This is done by solving a constrained optimization problem, where the objective function  is  to  maximize  the  margin  subject  to  the  constraint  that  all  data  points  are correctly classified. The decision boundary is given by the equation w*x+b=0, where w is the weight vector, x is the input vector, and b is the bias term.  Non-linear SVMs are a type of SVM that can handle data that is not linearly separable by transforming  the  input  data  into  a  higher-dimensional  space,  where  a  linear  decision boundary can be found. This is done using a kernel function that maps the input data into the higher-dimensional space. The most commonly used kernel functions are the radial basis function (RBF) kernel and the polynomial kernel.  The  math  for  non-linear  SVMs  involves  computing  the  kernel  function  for  each  pair  of input vectors, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets. Once the kernel matrix is computed, the optimization problem is solved to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin in the transformed space.  In summary, linear SVMs use a linear decision boundary to separate classes and are useful for high-dimensional data, while non-linear SVMs use kernel functions to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear decision boundary can be found. The math for linear SVMs involves finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin, while the math for non-linear SVMs involves computing the kernel function and solving the optimization problem in the transformed space.
