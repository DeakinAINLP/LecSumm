 This  topic's  topics  focused  on  Supervised  Learning,  with  a  specific  emphasis  on  Support  Vector Machines (SVM). The key points covered are:    SVM is a supervised machine learning technique that may be applied to both regression and  classification applications.    SVM separates the data points of several classes by locating the hyperplane that does so the  best.    A  key  component  of  SVM  is  the  notion  of  margin,  which  is  the  separation  between  the  hyperplane and the nearest data points for each class.    When a straight line or hyperplane can be utilised to divide the data, linear SVM is employed. Finding the hyperplane with the highest margin while keeping in mind certain restrictions is the goal of optimisation.Soft Margin SVM is used when the data cannot be separated linearly. The optimisation  problem is  given  here  with  the  addition of  a  penalty  term  to account  for some misclassifications.    The kernel trick is an effective method for moving data that cannot be separated linearly into a  higher-dimensional space where it can be separated linearly.    SVM can do multi-class classification using either the One-vs-All or One-vs-One method.   A statistical learning theory called Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension gives a measurement of how well a classifier can match any random set of points. SVM is a potent and trustworthy classifier since it has a low VC dimension.  SVM is a robust and adaptable machine learning method that can be utilised for a variety of applications, and this topic's topics thoroughly explored all of its different facets.
