 We  looked  into  logistic  and  linear  regression  last  topic.  Our knowledge  of  Python  programming  was  further  improved. This topic, we look at a number of linked ideas.  The following is a list of some of the major topics we research this topic:  Linear SVM. Nonlinear SVM.  SVM formulation and solution for linearly separable data. SVM formulation and solution for linearly non-separable data. We have so far assumed that data can be linearly separated. Data  may  occasionally  be  linearly  separable,  but  only  by  a small  margin.  Other  times,  noise  may  prevent  some  of  the cases  from  being  linearly  separable  (for  noisy  data,  see  the picture).  In  general,  it  is  preferable  to  avoid  influencing  the boundary, even when there are a few minor noisy data points or outliers. Large margins are acceptable even though some of the restrictions are broken. In real-world situations, we must compromise  between  the  margin  and the  quantity of  errors while categorising the training cases.  We arrive at the soft margin idea thanks to this trade-off. Take a look at the following illustration to see how the soft margin idea  is  established  when  the  training  examples  cannot  be separated  linearly.  soft  margin  dual  problem it  is  defined when  we  convert  the  initial  soft  margins  problem  to  a  dual problem. The only difference is that the Lagrange multipliers have a maximum value.          Kernel  trick  and  non-linear  SVM  and  we  went  through examples  of  linear  regression  we  referred  some  Deakin university  videos  for  better  understating  of  the  concepts. Statistical learning theory of SVM .Multi-Class classification in SVM it can be done in two ways 1.one vs all and 2. One vs one. In this method, samples from each class are treated as positive examples when training a binary SVM classifier, while samples from the other classes are treated as negative examples. We had  hands  on  experience  on  SVM  in  python  and  also  on polynomial kernel and RBF kernel
