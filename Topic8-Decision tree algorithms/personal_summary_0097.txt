This topic we covered SVM linear and non-linear models.  SVM (Support Vector Machine)– Machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The goal is to find the best possible line (hyperplane) separating different classes of data points. Can be linear or non-linear.  Soft margin dual problem – The concept in SVM that allows for some flexibility in handling datasets that are not perfectly separable. It does this by introducing a penalty for misclassifications and allowing for a certain degree of error.  Non-linear SVM – Used to handle datasets that are not linearly separable. A kernel function is employed to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where the classes can be separated by a hyperplane.  Multi-class classification in SVM – although SVM is designed for binary classification tasks, it can be extended to handle multi-class classification problems. Two approaches of multi-class SVM include One vs One, and One vs All.
