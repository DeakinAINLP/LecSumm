The main content of this topic is the SVM model. Including SVM, SVM model, python practice  SVM  Data is classified as linearly separable or non-separable. SVM is suitable for both types of data. We should allow some noise when processing data and adequately balance the data boundary and noise value.  SVM model  When performing regression, we need to consider tolerance to noise to ensure that overfitting does not occur. We also need to consider the accuracy of the model. Training Accuracy and Testing Accuracy are introduced to evaluate the degree of fit and prediction accuracy.  python practice  In Python, SVM has multiple modes, including linear, RBF, and poly. The penalty for the noise  value is adjusted by the parameter C.
