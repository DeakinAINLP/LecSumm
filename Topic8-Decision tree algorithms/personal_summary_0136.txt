1.1  SVM formulation and solution for linearly separable data SVM formulation solves optimization problem.  1.2  SVM formulation and solution for linearly non-separable data How SVM handles almost separable data points.  1.3  Support vector regression Example of linear regression.  1.4  Statistical learning theory of SVM The upper bound on the generalization error increases with higher complexity The upper bound on the generalization error reduces with larger training sets  1.5  Multi-class classification in SVM One vs all In this approach, for each class, a binary SVM classifier is trained with samples from that class being viewed  as  positive  examples  and  samples  from  the  other  classes  being  viewed  as  negative examples. One vs One In  this  method, the SVM  algorithm  trains  multiple  binary  classifiers,  each  trained  to  distinguish between two classes.  1.6    SVM in python- Polynomial kernel AND Linear kernel AND RBF kernel
