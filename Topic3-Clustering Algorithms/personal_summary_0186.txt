Data Wrangling  Module Learning Objectives –  I certify that I have successfully learned and understood the following topics:  1.  Definition of statistics 2.  Random variables 3.  Distributions and ways 4.  Data wrangling basics 5.  Images as data 6.  Text data representation 7.  Data vs Signal 8.  Encoding and distribution 9.  Scaling and normalization 10. Data wrangling in python  Summary and reflection –  The  pages  below  contain  the  handwritten  summary  referring  to  the  given  learning resources. It includes all the important points of the topic 2 module.  Since I have done SIT220, this part of the unit was easier to understand and follow through. This  module  allowed  me  to  refresh  my  memory  on  what  I  have  learned  earlier  on  data wrangling. This module covered the basics of many important data-wrangling theories and methods  and  introduces  us  to  the  keywords  and  algorithms  which  we  are  going  to  use throughout the unit.  After covering the theories and basic concepts in the second part of the module we learnt more  about  how  to  perform  the  operations  and  methods  we  learnt  in  the  earlier  part  in python with practical questions. The pass activity allowed me to go through many materials and learn more than what I have known before.
