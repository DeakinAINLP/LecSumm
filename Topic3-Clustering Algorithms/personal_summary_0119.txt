In topic 2, we focused more on data wrangling, the procedure of manipulating and analyzing raw data into an easier to read and process format . We continued working on our manipulation of arrays and matrices, and learned how to make data easier to follow. The main focus for this were encoding, distribution, and scaling of the data. Encoding is a great process as it allows for categorical values to be evaluated, by turning them into a set of quantitative values. The computer is then able to make use of this data, which it could not do so before. Distribution refers to the way that the values in a dataset are spread out. The distribution of these values have a significant impact on machine learning algorithms. If the data is skewed towards one side, the algorithm may favor and be biased towards certain values. Similarly, scaling has a significant impact on machine algorithms and can make it easier for algorithms to perform. Scaling serves the purpose of allowing different data to be compared, by transforming the values into a common range. By scaling the values down into a range from 0 to 1, like the case of normalization, the data is now in an objective scale that can be compared used to compare different units of measure such as the ones for height and weight.
