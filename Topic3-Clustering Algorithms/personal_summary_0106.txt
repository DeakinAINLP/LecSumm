 ①This topic mainly talks about two points. The first is the basic knowledge of statistics including Probability and random variables, The third is the concept and manipulation related to Data Wrangling. ②To get familiar with the data processing, I consults a lot of python API manual, including how to fill NA. I also watched a video about how to convert image data into matrices. ③ What impresses me most are the distribution of random variables,  the image data representation and text data representation. Some steps of data wrangling such as scaling and how to do data wrangling using python also let me reflect them deeply.
