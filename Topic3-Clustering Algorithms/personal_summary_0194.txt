This topic, I did a preliminary study of probability and learned about random variables and its distribution. Then I learned Data wrangling, and also learned the meaning and method of Scaling and Normalization. 2. https://pandas.pydata.org/ 3. probability and need to master the knowledge of random variables. When I get a piece of data, I need to perform a series of preprocessing operations to convert the data into a language that the machine can understand and convert it into a range that is most suitable for the model output. Through this topic's tasks, I learned and studied how to process data with python and mastered techniques such as filling in missing data and storing it. I feel like the second topic is packed with content and I need some time to digest it all.
