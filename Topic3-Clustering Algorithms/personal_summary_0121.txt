 This topic was very interesting as I learned about how to do manipulations on a Data Frame. I learned about how to find out the missing entries in the data set and how to eliminate the missing entries by filling up alternate values using fillna() functuin.  Moreover I learned how to replace a set of data with another data using replace function. Also this was very interesting in which I saved and created a new file where updated data was saved. Also I learned about how to do min max scaling of a data set and plotting data on graphs using matplotlib library.
