In topic 2 , we expanded our knowledge on the basics of machine learning via learning about data wrangling and how we can use data with MLA. These segments included:    Basic definitions of statistics: Here we learnt about definitions that can be used within statistics,  such as  o  Random experiment (Experiment where outcome cannot be predicted) o  Event (set of outcomes of a random experiment) o  Probability (measuring the likelihood of and event) o o  Conditional probability (basing probability on event A, given results from event B) o  Bayes rule (Changing beliefs from outcome of results)  Joint probability (measuring the likelihood of more than one event)    Random Variables: which are variables that possess the ability to contain values from a random phenomenon and can assign probabilities to events of interest in a random experiment. There are also two types of random variables: o  Discrete (countable values) o  Continuous (infinite continuum)    Images as data: Here we learnt the steps and process of splitting an image up into segments and extract features, and that to use an image for input data, it must be presented.    Data wrangling: Which is essentially a process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing data. It  can also be known as data munging.    Data vs signal: Where we learnt the differences between data and signals, however signal is just  another form of data.    Encoding and distribution: Which had us learn that encoding is used to convert to an integer,  whereas distribution is just the way that values within a dataset are distributed.
