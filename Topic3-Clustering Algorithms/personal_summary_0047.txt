The main points covered this topic covered the diï¬€erent types of probability for an event and how likely is would occur, this is given as a value between 0 and 1. We also discussed random variables which are is variables whose possible values are the generated outcomes of a random phenomenon.  A simple explanation of a probability distribution is that it is a function that links each outcome of a statistical experiment with its probability of occurrence. This led into the idea of Data wrangling where we gather then transform and analyze our data in order to answer a perceived question with the results.  This process is taken to transform raw data into a tangible and easily digestible format that can then be read and interpreted easily to form conclusions.
