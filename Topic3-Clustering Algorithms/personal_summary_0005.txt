Probability plays a significant role in ML algorithms. If A is an event, probability of A can be defined as the proportion of successes of event A, written as P(A) . There are two types of random variables, discrete and continuous. Discrete random variables can be quantified and are defined using Probability mass function (PMF). Continuous random variables  can  take  values  on  infinite  continuum  and  are  defined  using  Probability  density function  (PDF).  Random  variables  can  be  distributed  as  Bernoulli,  uniform  and  normal distribution or by central limit theorem. For data to be useful and meaningful, it must be curated and refined, which is accomplished using data wrangling . Two important python packages for data wrangling are NumPy and Pandas libraries. The general steps involved in data wrangling are [2]:   Scraping raw data  Imputing, formatting, and transforming   Handling errors and outliers   Performing quick visualizations judging the quality of your formatted data Features  which  are  measurable  property  or  characteristics  can  be  either  quantitative  or categorical. Categorical features cannot be used for ML so it has to be encoded using techniques like ordinal encoder, one-hot encoding and label encoder. Scaling is another data wrangling step used to scales varies features to a uniform scale. Finally looked at data wrangling using Python programming
