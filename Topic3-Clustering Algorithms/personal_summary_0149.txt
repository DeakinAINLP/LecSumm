variables and their probability distributions i.e Bernoulli, uniform and random distributions.  Diving into data wrangling which was the major take away for the topic, I got to understand the tasks involved in the data wrangling process and tackled each step conclusively together with the various forms of data representation such as textual and image data.  To add on this, I was able to learn the ways of encoding categorical values into machine understandable integer values together with ways of improving the performance of machine learning models undusteanding the data distribution within the model including normal, uniform, and skewed distributions.
