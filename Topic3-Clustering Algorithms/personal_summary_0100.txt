 During  the  second  topic  of  2  formal  classes  and  workshops,  I  was  explained  math-based  ML. Mathematics underpins all decisions, iterations and outputs; hence Machine Learning can be called dependent on mathematics. Therefore, this topic we are learning about ML-related math problems like  vectors  and  basic  vector  operations,  matrices  and  matrix  operations,  and  the  basics  of probability.  In  Basics  of  Probability,  I  was  introduced  to  concepts  and  examples  of  general probability,  conditional  probability,  Bayes'  rule,  and  random  and  event  testing.  I  was  also introduced to the concept and distribution of random variables. In addition, it is the definition of data sorting, encoding of non-numerical data, and the principle in the absence of surrogate values, scaling or normalization. Ultimately, it is all about the discipline's single programming language, Python..
