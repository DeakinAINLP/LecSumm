In topic 2, we learned about Mathematics that is required for Machine Learning. Math underlies every decision, iteration and output. We learnt about how in order to get the best results we must have the knowledge and understanding to know that some models give better results than others, depending upon the parameters you set for them you can maximize the output. Some of the main areas we covered this topic were: ● Vectors and basic vector operations ● Matrices and matrix operations ● Probability ● Python: using different modules and packages  We learnt about the basic terminology of Statistics, Random variable and their probabilities, Distributions of random variables, Data wrangling, Feature Extraction, Representation of text data, Encoding and distribution, Data and Signal, Scaling and normalization, Statistics in data science, Data loading and saving and Data exploration.
