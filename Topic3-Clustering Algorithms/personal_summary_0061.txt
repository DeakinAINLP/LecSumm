 Summarise the main points covered  This topic the main topics covered are vector, matrices and the implementation in python  - -  What is probability, events conditional probability -  Random variables, variables that can not be predicted -  Data wrangling, is the process of cleaning, transforming and organising a dataset -  Some examples of data wrangling are, fixing errors, incomplete values, inconsistencies, combining datasets, removing outliers or creating useful statistics.  -  Using Images as data, how to make the computer understand images with algorithms as  -  computers understand numbers Encoding, the act of converting data into a format that machine can understand, this includes changing categorical data into integer values so the machine can understand Scaling, converting the set of values to an we range of values  - -  Normalisation is a scaling technique that transforms the data into a common range  I now have a better understanding in vector, matrices and probability. Also learned some key features in data wrangling in python.
