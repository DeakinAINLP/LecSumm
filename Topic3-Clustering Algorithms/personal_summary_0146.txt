In this topic, I have covered a variety of topics related to statistics, data wrangling, and data science. Here's a summary of what I learned:  I started learning some basic statistical concepts, such as the mean, median, and mode, as well as measures of spread, such as the standard deviation and variance. Then  I’ve  learned  about  discrete  and  continuous  random  variables,  as  well  as probability  mass  functions  and  probability  density  functions.  After  that  I understood different types of distributions that random variables can follow, such as the normal distribution, binomial distribution, and Poisson distribution. We also learned  how  to  use  probability  distribution  functions  to  calculate  probabilities. Hereafter I’ve learned about data wrangling, which involves preparing and cleaning data for analysis. Under data wrangling, missing values, handle outliers, scaling and normalization, data transformation, encoding were studied.  During the lab sessions, I’ve learned Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy to perform data wrangling tasks such as cleaning data, merging datasets, and handling missing  values,  load  and  save  data  in  different  formats,  such  as  CSV,  JSON,  and Excel. For that numpy, pandas and sklearn were used. Data exploration involves visually  analyzing  and  summarizing  data  to  gain  insights.  Visualizing  techniques such as scatter plots, box plots, and histograms were used with matplotlib library.
