 Main points of this module:    A random experiment is a process with an outcome that is not predictable with absolute certainty. An event is the set of these outcomes. Probability is defined for each event between 0 and 1. Join probability is for more than one event. Conditional probability is the probability of an event given another occurrence.    Discrete random variables have a countable number of values, continuous random variables  can take values on an infinite continuum.    Distributions of random variables include the Bernoulli distribution (discrete), uniform  distribution (discrete and continuous), normal distribution (continuous), and the central limit theorem (uses the mean and standard deviation).    Data wrangling involves correcting errors in data, handling missing/incomplete values, combining multiple datasets, converting data, removing outliers, normalising data and aggregating data into useful summary statistics. Images can have features extracted using a grid model, allowing data to be extracted such as average colour of each block.      Text also must be converted, as computers only understand numbers. By encoding, we can  assign quantitative values for categorical features.    A signal is a sign or gesture that conveys certain information, it can be a form of information  once represented in an organised and consistent manner.    Scaling refers to the process of converting a set of values to a new range of values, for  example. An example of this is min-max normalisation which converts all values to be within a new range, between 0 and 1. This creates a way of standardising the data.
