 The Main points that I’ve covered in the second topic are as follows:  ➢  I have understood the concept of Statistics and Probability and use of these statistics with  respect to Machine Learning.  ➢  Different Probability models such as Joint Probability, Conditional Probability and Bayes  rule, Uniform Distribution, Bernoulli Distribution and Normal distribution etc.  ➢  The main part in the second topic was Data Wrangling and the process of Data cleaning and  making our data more useful for predictions.  ➢  Importing Seaborn and plotting different Distributions based on the data  My Learning summary Based on 2nd Topics Lecture was about Data Pre-processing and handling the data, making the data useful with scaling or standardizing the data. I have used Data exploration techniques and I have understood the Encoding technique in which I can convert Categorical data to Numerical Data and so on.  Knowledge gained with Data Wrangling.  In the Overall topic 2 I have gained the Knowledge of how to use a csv file and perform different operations on a csv data such as Data loading, Filling nan values by mean, median or mode and after that Data exploration and Encoding the categorical data and transforming it to a useful dataset.  Hence the Topic two was very useful and interesting by understanding the concept of Data Wrangling.
