Data wrangling is cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency in data analysis. It can be divided into three sections: Data loading and saving, Data exploration and Data encoding, distribution and Scaling. To teach a machine to analyse and categorize images, we find features that can be represented with numbers to recognize patterns in images, allowing them to classify them into relevant categories. Distribution of random variables refers to the probability distribution of the possible values that a random variable can take and provides information on the likelihood of each outcome. Some of the important distributions are Bernoulli, uniform, and normal distributions. For this task, the reading material was provided in the unit learning resources was enough to get my basics revised as I have studied distributions in my high school maths. For pass activity, I didnâ€™t need to refer to w3schools this time either as the unit resources provided enough basics along with getting me to figure minor coding by myself. I was already aware of the concepts of Normal distribution, Random variables, and Discrete Random variables are fundamental concepts in probability theory and statistics, which are essential in machine learning for data processing, model building, and evaluation. Understanding these concepts have helped me in wrangling data for analysis, identifying and handling outliers. The knowledge gained this topic has deepened the understanding of these concepts and how they are applied in machine learning. And the most important thing I learned is how to manipulate raw data into suitable format in python.
