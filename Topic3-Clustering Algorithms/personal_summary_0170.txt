 Machine Learning & Probability   In Machine Learning, mathematics underpins every decision, iteration and output.   Probability plays a major role in many machine learning algorithms, and classically  defined as:   P(E)=  Total number of outcomes in Event ________________________________________________ Total number of outcomes in the sample space   An event is an outcome of a Random Experiment.   Conditional Probability is the probability of some event A, given the occurrence of  Joint probability defining probability for more than 1 event.  another event B.   Bayes Rule, mathematically represents change your existing beliefs in the light of new occurrence described as the probability of an event A based on another event B that is related to A.  Random Variables   A random variable, is a variable whose possible values are the generated  outcomes of a random phenomenon.   2 type of random variables   discrete random variables are the result of a chance event that can be counted  (countable number of values) and can be defined using probablity mass functions and Cumulative distribution function   continuous random variable which can take values on a infinite continuum and are  defined using probability distribution functions   Distribution of random variables   Bernoulli distribution  Uniform Distribution  Normal Distribution  Data Wrangling   Data Wrangling which is part of the data science pipeline involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing a dataset to make it suitable for analysis and ensuring the Machine learning model is not misguided, improve model performance:  Identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in the data  Handling missing or incomplete values, replacement with immediate value of  median/mean   Combining multiple datasets  Converting the data into a format that is suitable for analysis for example Non-  numeric Data encoding converted to integer values using OrdinalEncoder, One Hot Encodings, LabelEncoder for machine learning models.   Identifying bias and removing outliers, by examining types of distributions that a  dataset has , including normal, uniform, and skewed distributions.   Scale or Normalization converts values into a standardized range e.g 0-1 and min-  max normalization to improve machine model performance.   Aggregating the data into useful summary statistics  Python & Machine Learning   Some of the key mathematical concepts and processes that are  essential for machine learning include vectors and vector operations, matrices and matrix operations, probability.  In many applications in order to use input data for machine  learning algorithms, it needs to be represented in a numerical vector of features.   Feature vectors and matrices represents an object or a  document in a vector space model.   Information retrieval operations use vector space models for representing and comparing documents or objects based on their features to finding relevant documents or objects from a large collection based on a query or a criterion.
