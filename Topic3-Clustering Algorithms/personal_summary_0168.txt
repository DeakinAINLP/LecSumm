 Linear Algebra and Probability  Vector space model is representation of set of documents as vectors.  Stacking vector / feature vector gives Matrix / Feature Matrix  Probability = Measure of likelihood of an event happening. Joint probability = Probability of both independent events happening  Conditional probability =  Probability of an event happening given the probability of another related event happening  Types of Variable and their distribution  Discrete Random Variable – countable  and Continuous Random Variable – values of infinite continuum  Data wrangling  Cleaning, transforming and organizing  dataset  replace missing value with immediate value...  Non numerical data encoding – convert categorical to numerical values .
