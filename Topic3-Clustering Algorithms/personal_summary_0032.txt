The key points covered in topic two are:  1.  Basics of statistics from the introduction of the random experiment, probability of a single event, multiple events, conditional events and Bayes Rule which is the probability of an even when taking into account prior knowledge. Introduction to random discrete and random continuous variables and the respective Probability Mass Function and Probability Density Function.  Important distributions such as the normal distribution and the concept of Central Limit Theorem which can be used to evaluate model performance using statistical significance tests and confidence intervals.  3.  Data Wrangling which is how data in various forms is transformed so it can be used for Machine Learning.  The original data is encoded so that it can be represented in numerical form.  It is then further processed using scaling, standardisation, and normalisation methods to improve model accuracy. Python libraries such as numpy, scikitlearn, scipy, pandas and matplotlib can be used for exploratory data analysis and data wrangling.
