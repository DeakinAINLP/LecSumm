In this topic we studied about the correlation between machine learning and mathematics, Statistics, probability concepts, random variables , data wrangling and its fundamental concepts. It was more explanatory about Linear algebra and probability.  Random experiment was a major part of discussion of probability, which included event and sample space. A random variable that can take a countable number of values is called Discrete random variable, we used it when the outcome is a set of distinct and separate value. We learned different distribution methods of random variables, like Bernoulli, uniform and normal distribution. We studied different kind of probability like, Conditional probability, Joint probability and Byes rule calculates probability of an event occurring bases on prior knowledge or evidence.  In Feature extraction we extract relevant information from a raw data to create feature vector, which is used to train the model.  Data wrangling is a process of data cleaning, in this data is transformed to prepare raw data to meaningful analytical data. It involves error correction, missing and incomplete data handelling and transforming data into standardized format.  Scaling or normalization is a data processing where the numeric values of data set are transformed into a common range. Immediate, mean and median values are an important part of data wrangling.
