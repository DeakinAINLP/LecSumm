1.  The term "probability," which is used frequently in mathematics and statistics, refers to a measurement of the likelihood that a specific event will occur. Contrarily, joint probability denotes the likelihood that two or more events will occur simultaneously, whereas conditional probability denotes the likelihood that an event will take place after another has already happened.  2.  Random variables are those whose values depend on how a random event turns out. While a continuous random variable can take on any value within an interval, a discrete random variable can only take on a finite or countable number of values.  3.  A type of probability distribution called the normal distribution, also referred to as the Gaussian distribution, is frequently used to model random variables with a bell-shaped curve. The Uniform distribution, in contrast, is a kind of probability distribution where each potential result has an equal chance of happening. Contrarily, the Bernoulli distribution is a probability distribution in which the random variable can only have two outcomes, each with a fixed probability.  4.  Cleaning, transforming, and getting ready raw data for analysis is known as data wrangling. Data cleaning, data integration, data transformation, data reduction, and data formatting are just a few of the many tasks that fall under this category.  5.  In contrast, selecting or extracting the most important features from a dataset that can be used for machine learning constitutes feature extraction. It involves converting the raw data into a format that a machine learning algorithm can use, which is a challenging process.  6.  Algorithms or systems that can recognise patterns in data and forecast future events or  make decisions based on that information are known as machine learning models. Choosing the right algorithm, pre-processing the data, training the model, and assessing its performance are all necessary steps in the creation of a model.  7.  Text data representation involves transforming text data into a numerical format that  machine learning algorithms can use. There are many methods for representing text data, including bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings, each with their own benefits and drawbacks.  8.  Finally, despite the fact that they require different pre-processing and analysis methods,  data and signals are two crucial components of machine learning. Signals are time-varying measurements of a physical phenomenon, such as sound or radio waves, that can be analysed using machine learning techniques. In contrast to data, which refers to any information used to train or test a machine learning algorithm, signals are not considered to be data.
