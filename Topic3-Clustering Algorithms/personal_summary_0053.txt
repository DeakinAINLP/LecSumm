 In this topic we get accustomed to the concept of Data Wrangling technique.     We start of with first getting familiar with the concept of adding random values to the list and  operate them according to the requirement.    We then learn the process of feature extraction which is essential in buiding Machine Learning  Models and also data representation.    We then learn about the concepts of encoding, Distribution, scaling and Normalisation.  EXPLANATION FOR PROBLEM SOLVINGS:    We read the given dataset train_wbcd_csv using the pd.read function and find number of  missing entries and also find out the feature name.    We find out the mean value of the dataset and replace the null values with the mean of the  corressponding values.    We encode the diagnosis categorical variable with the label encoder because it has only two  values B and M and hence we consider them as 0 OR 1.    We take the features from f1 to f30 and we apply the min max scaling technique and we plot the  resultant distribution before and after scaling.
