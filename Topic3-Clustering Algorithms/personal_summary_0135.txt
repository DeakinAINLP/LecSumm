This  topic  I  learned  a  lot  of  knowledge,  including  statistical  foundation,  random  number  foundation,  discrete  distribution  and  other  mathematical  knowledge,  as  well  as  data  organization,  including pictures, text data, feature extraction, etc. It also includes  the comparison of data and signals, the comparison of encoding and  distribution, scaling and normalization, and other concepts.  Of  course,  the  most  important  thing I  still  think  is  Python  content,  including  how  to  generate  random  numbers,  how  to  generate  discrete  numbers,  statistics  and  drawing.  How  to  read  and  store  data.  How  to  observe  the  data.  How  to  add,  delete,  check  and  modify data, and draw related images.
