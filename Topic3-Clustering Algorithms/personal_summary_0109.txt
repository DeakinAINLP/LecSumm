Statistics : basic definitions  Learning Outcome Summary:  Probability is a fundamental concept in machine learning algorithms and is used to measure  the likelihood of an event occurring.  A random experiment refers to an experiment or process where the outcome cannot be  predicted with certainty.  An event in probability is defined as a set of outcomes of a random experiment.  Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of an event  occurring or not occurring.  Joint probability refers to the probability of two or more events occurring simultaneously,  assuming they are independent.  Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has  already occurred.  Bayes' rule describes the probability of an event based on the occurrence of another related  event and is commonly used in Bayesian approaches.  Understanding probability is crucial for making informed decisions and adjusting beliefs based  on new information.  Random variables  Learning Outcome Summary:  A random variable is a variable that represents the possible outcomes of a random  phenomenon.  Random variables can assign probabilities to events of interest in a random experiment.  Discrete random variables have a countable number of values, such as the faces of a dice, and  are defined using Probability Mass Functions (PMF).  PMF assigns a probability to each possible value of the random variable, summing to 1.  Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) gives the cumulative probability associated with a  function, providing information about the probability of values less than or equal to a certain  value.  Continuous random variables can take values on an infinite continuum, such as height or time  to failure, and are defined using Probability Density Functions (PDF).  PDF assigns probabilities to ranges of values, integrating to 1.  The probability assigned to an exact value in continuous space is zero, but probabilities can be  discussed over ranges of values.  Understanding random variables, their probability distributions, and the distinction between  discrete and continuous random variables is important for analyzing and modeling various  types of data in machine learning and statistics.  Distributions of random variables  Learning Outcome  Probability distribution is a function that connects each outcome of a statistical experiment  with its probability of occurrence.  Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution for a binary random variable, representing  outcomes with probabilities of success and failure.  Uniform distribution can be defined for both discrete and continuous random variables, where  all outcomes have equal probabilities.  Normal distribution is a continuous distribution and the most popular one, often observed in  natural phenomena.  Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal  distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the underlying distribution of the  population. Understanding different probability distributions is essential in statistical analysis  and modeling to describe and analyze random variables and their behavior.  Data Wrangling  Learning Outcome  Wikipedia. Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of  transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the  intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes  such as analytics.  Data wrangling, or data munging, is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing a  dataset to make it suitable for analysis.  Data wrangling involves tasks such as identifying and correcting errors, handling missing  values, combining datasets, converting data formats, removing outliers, normalizing data, and  aggregating data.  Data wrangling can be a complex and time-consuming process, requiring both manual and  automated techniques.  Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data science pipeline, as it prepares the data for analysis  and insights.  Proficiency in data wrangling allows data scientists to work with messy, unstructured, and  incomplete data and extract meaningful information from it.  Feature extraction  Learning Outcome  Feature extraction is a crucial step in machine learning, where the goal is to derive a set of  informative features from raw data.  In feature extraction, the aim is to represent the data in a numerical format that can be  understood by machine learning algorithms.  Feature extraction is particularly important when working with complex data types like  images, where meaningful features need to be extracted to make accurate predictions.  The process of feature extraction involves identifying relevant characteristics or patterns in the  data and transforming them into a feature vector or matrix.  These features can be computed based on different properties of the data, such as color, shape,  texture, or statistical measures.  The resulting feature matrix can then be used as input for machine learning algorithms to train  models and make predictions or classifications.  By selecting and extracting informative features, the machine learning system can learn  patterns and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.  Text data representation  Learning Outcome  Text data representation is a crucial step in machine learning and data analysis, as computers  primarily understand and process numerical data.  To analyze and interpret large volumes of data effectively, it is necessary to represent non-  numerical data such as words, images, and ideas in a numerical format.  Data representation involves converting text data into a structured form that can be processed  by machine learning algorithms. This process is essential for creating models and extracting  meaningful insights from text data.  Feature selection is a critical aspect of data representation, as it involves identifying and  choosing the relevant attributes or parameters that will be used to describe the text data.  Feature vectors are commonly used to represent text data numerically. These vectors capture  the important features or characteristics of the text and transform them into a table or matrix of  numbers.  Understanding the concepts of data representation and feature vectors is fundamental to  effectively applying machine learning algorithms to text data.  Data VS signal  Data and signals are both forms of information, but they have some key differences  Data: Data refers to observations or measurements that are stored in the form of text, numbers,  or media. It can be collected from various sources and represents information that is  potentially meaningful and useful. Data can be structured or unstructured and can be  processed, analyzed, and transformed to generate insights and make informed decisions.  Signal: In the context of digital electronics or signal processing, a signal refers to a quantity  that varies over a parameter such as space or time. Signals can represent various phenomena  such as sound, electrical impulses, or physical measurements. Signals are often represented as   mathematical functions that describe the relationship between independent and dependent  variables. They can be captured, analyzed, and processed to extract specific information or  characteristics.  The main difference between data and signals lies in their representation and purpose. Data is  more general and can encompass a wide range of information, whereas signals specifically  refer to quantities that vary over a parameter. Data can be organized and structured to derive  meaning, while signals are typically used to convey specific information about a phenomenon  or process.  Encoding and Distribution  Encoding: Encoding techniques are used to convert categorical values into integer  representations that can be understood by machine learning algorithms. This is necessary  because machines typically work with numerical data. Techniques like OrdinalEncoder, One-  Hot Encoding, and LabelEncoder are commonly used for encoding categorical features. By  assigning numeric codes to categorical values, the data can be processed and used for training  machine learning models.  Distribution: Distribution refers to the way values are spread or distributed in a dataset.  Different types of distributions exist, including normal, uniform, and skewed distributions.  The normal distribution is characterized by a bell-shaped curve, where the data is  symmetrically distributed around the mean. A uniform distribution indicates that the values are  evenly spread across the range, while a skewed distribution means that the values are  concentrated more on one side.  The distribution of values in a dataset can impact the performance of machine learning  algorithms. Biased or imbalanced distributions can lead to biased predictions and affect the  accuracy of the model. On the other hand, a normally distributed dataset can facilitate learning  and prediction.  For example, when studying the heights of students in a SIT720 course, plotting the heights as  a histogram and observing the distribution curve can show a bell-shaped curve. The  distribution curve represents the normal distribution of heights in the dataset, providing  insights into how the data is spread and enabling further analysis and modeling.  Scaling and Normalisation  Scaling: Scaling is the process of converting a set of values to a new range. In machine  learning, scaling is often performed on features to ensure they are on a similar scale. This is  important because features with different ranges can have varying impacts on the model's  performance. Scaling helps prevent certain features from dominating the model and allows for  optimal results.  Normalization: Normalization is a type of scaling technique that transforms the values of a  dataset into a common range. By normalizing the data, the values are standardized, which can  improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. One common method of  normalization is min-max normalization, where the data is scaled to a range of 0 to 1. This  normalization is achieved by subtracting the minimum value from each data point and dividing  it by the range of the data.  Overall, scaling and normalization are essential steps in preparing data for machine learning.  They ensure that features are on a similar scale, preventing bias and allowing algorithms to  effectively learn from the data.  Statistics in data science  Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation,  presentation, and organization of data.  Random Variables: A random variable is a variable whose values are outcomes of a random  phenomenon. It can assign probabilities to events of interest in a random experiment. Random  variables can be discrete or continuous.  Discrete Random Variables: Discrete random variables take on a countable set of distinct  values. The probabilities associated with each value determine the likelihood of its occurrence.  They can be visualized using probability mass functions (PMF) or bar charts. The cumulative  distribution function (CDF) gives the cumulative probability associated with a random  variable.  Continuous Random Variables: Continuous random variables can take on any value within a  given range or interval. They are described by probability density functions (PDF). The area  under the PDF curve within a specific interval gives the probability of the random variable  falling within that interval.  Statistics provides tools and techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, making  inferences, and drawing conclusions. It plays a vital role in data analysis, decision making, and  scientific research.
