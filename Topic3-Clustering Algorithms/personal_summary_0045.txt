 Probability concepts  Random experiment   Learnt that it is an experiment which the outcome can not be predicted with certainty before it occurs, such as flipping a coin or flipping a playing card.  Event   Learnt that it’s a set of outcomes of a random experiment such as picking a number between 1 to 10 with sample space Ω = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 } and event А = { {1},{2},{3},{4},{5},{6},{7},{8},{9},{10}}.  Probability  Learnt that probability is a measurement of the likelihood of a defined event that will occur such as picking a number of 5 between 1 to 10 is P(A) = 1/10 where P(A) is the probability of that event.   Joint Probability   Learnt that joint probability is where more than one event is occurring together and are independent to one another such as P(A and B) = P(A) * P (B) where two events are occurring together  Conditional probability   Learnt that conditional probability is an event given the occurrence of another event. P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)  Bayes Rule  I learnt that it is a probability theory that explains how you should change our existing beliefs about an event occurring given new information. Where probability of an event A is based on another event B that is related to event A  P(A|B) = ( P(B|A) * P(A) ) / P(B) Where P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A ’ ) * P(A ’ )  Random variable  I learnt that random variables is a variable that is assigned to values where the outcome is a random anomaly. Defining a random variable and allocating all the values/outcomes of random events that occur.  Discrete random variable  Where it is a countable number such as numbers in a dice and number of emails    Learnt that it is defined using Probability Mass Functions(PMF) and it assigns a probability for each possible value of the random variable. Where π(x) = P(X = x) and the sum of it totals to 1. Learnt about Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) function that gives us the sum of probability with the associated rule. Such as find the probability of x between two values P( a ≤ x ≤ b ) in a dice  Continuous random variable  Where it has values that have an infinite continuum such as the height of a person and length of rope.   Learnt that it is defined using Probability Density Functions (PDF) where we use the integral ∫ f(x)dx = 1 to calculate the probability.  Distribution of random variables   Learnt Bernoulli distribution being a discrete distribution that’s defined as a binary random variable of values X=0 and X=1  Uniform distribution being both a discrete and continuous distribution Normal distribution being a popular distribution that is defined for continuous random variables, has two parameters of mean and standard deviation.  Central limit theorem is a concept that having a large random sample size will result in the distribution of the sample means being normally distributed.  Data wrangling Learnt that is involves cleaning, transforming and organizing a messy and incomplete dataset  Missing value replacement    Learnt that this is an essential part of data wrangling as the machine learning model cannot process missing values (null) and can cause the model to be inaccurate. Learnt that we can replace these missing values with the immediate value, the mean or median value of the row of the data.  Scale or normalization    Learnt that this is a technique that transforms the values of a dataset into a common range that is usually a range of 0 to 1. It is often done to improve the performance of the model  Non-numeric data encoding   Learnt that we can use an encoding technique to convert categorical values to integer values in the model. There are several techniques called Ordinal Encoder, Label Encoder and One-Hot Endonings.  Data Wrangling with Python   I have learnt how to create discrete random variables using scipy.     I have learnt how to create a random dataset and save the dataset using pandas and numpy. I have learnt how to find missing values in a pandas dataframe and replace them with the immediate value of the row. I have learnt how to use non-numeric data encoding on a dataset and scale or normalize a dataset using Z-score normalization.
