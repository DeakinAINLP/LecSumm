Probability:    Probability  can  be  used  as  a  tool  to  estimate  the  possibility  of  an  occurrence happening. It is an integer between zero and one, with zero indicating that there is no probability  and  one  indicating  that  all  possibilities  have  been  investigated  and eliminated. In order to perform a probability calculation, you need to be aware of both the total number of outcomes and the number of possible outcomes that are favourable to you. To  determine  the  likelihood  of  an  event  happening,  simply  divide  the  number  of favourable  outcomes  by  the  total  number  of  possibilities.  This  will  give  you  the probability.      When using a die with six sides and a random outcome, the probability of receiving a one is one in six due to the fact that there is only one positive result (rolling a 1) out of the six different outcomes that could occur. What would happen if you rolled a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6?    Several  disciplines,  including  mathematics,  statistics,  physics,  engineering,  and finance, all rely heavily on the idea of probability as an essential component of their work. It is able to model unlikely occurrences and extrapolate information from the past in order to forecast the future. Probability is a useful tool for risk assessment and for guiding decision making in the face of ambiguity.  Random Variables:    A  random  variable,  whose  value  might  change  based  on  chance  or  random circumstances, is typically denoted with a capital letter, such as X or Y. This is because the value of a random variable can change based on a variety of factors. In the fields of probability theory and statistics, the term "random variable" refers to the way in which certain events cannot have their consequences predicted in advance.  Random variables can be divided into two categories:    Discrete Random Variable:  A  discrete  random  variable  can  only  ever  take  on  one  of  a  limited  number  of predetermined states at any given time. A discrete random variable is one that can only take on values that fall between zero and ten, such as the percentage of times a coin  lands  on  its  head  after  being  flipped  ten  times.  The  number  of  students  in  a classroom, the number of cars on the road at a particular time, and the number of red marbles in a bag are all examples of discrete random variables.    Continuous Random Variable:  Because  they  are  capable  of  taking  on  any  value,  continuous  random  variables  are referred  to  by  that  descriptor.  Continuous  random  variables  include  things  like  a person's  height  or  the  number  of  years  a  light  bulb  will  remain  functional.  The temperature of a room, the speed of a moving vehicle, or the weight of an object are a few instances of such conditions.  It is essential to differentiate between these two kinds of random variables in order to properly  analyse  them,  as  doing  so  requires  the  application  of  unique  mathematical models and methods of statistical analysis.  Probability Distribution:    Probability distributions are functions that characterise the range of outcomes that could occur in a random occurrence. These outcomes could be anything from one to an infinite number of possibilities. It is feasible to assign probabilities to each of the potential values of a random variable. A probability distribution provides information regarding the likelihood that a particular value of a random variable will in fact take place.  There are a number of different probability distributions, the most frequent of which are as follows:    Discrete Probability Distributions:  The probability distributions for the countable random variables that are known as discrete random variables may be found here. These countable random variables can have  either  finite  or  infinite  values.  The  geometric  distribution,  the  Poisson distribution,  and  the  binomial  distribution  are  a  few  examples  of  the  types  of distributions that fall under this category.    Continuous Probability Distributions:   Because the probable range of values for continuous random variables is unbounded and  infinite,  probability  distributions  are  used  to  describe  the  behaviour  of  such variables  when  describing  their  behaviour.  The  normal,  exponential,  and  uniform distributions are three examples of the many different types of distributions. Joint Probability Distributions: These probability distributions assign values or weights to every combination of two or more random variables that is even remotely feasible. The copula distribution, the multinomial distribution, and the bivariate normal distribution are a few examples of the types of distributions that fall under this category.    Conditional Probability Distributions:  Conditional probability distributions are used to determine how likely something is to occur  given  the  occurrence  of  another  event  in  the  same  scenario.  Conditional distributions  include  the  Poisson  distribution,  the  normal  distribution,  and  the binomial distribution, to name a few examples of these types of distributions.  The type of random variable and the nature of the issue being investigated both play a part in  determining  the  probability  distribution  that  is  used.  Understanding  and  making  use  of probability distributions is extremely important in a wide variety of fields, including but not limited to statistics, physics, economics, and engineering.
