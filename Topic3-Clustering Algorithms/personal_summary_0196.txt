Content Summary In this module, I have learned the following topics:   Basic statistics topics such as probability, joint probability, conditional probability and bayes  rule.   Two types of random variables, discrete and continuous, their properties and real-world  examples of them.   Three different types of distributions of random variables and the central limit theorem:   Bernoulli distribution   Uniform distribution   Normal distribution   Data wrangling as a concept, the steps involved and its purpose    Feature extraction, which is turning data into machine-readable formats (numbers)   Text data representation, and how the “bag-of-words” model helps the computer interpret the  text   Common encoding methods for categorical values which as OrdinalEncoder, One-Hot  Encoding and LabelEncoder to make them understandable by machine learning algorithms   Common distribution types such as normal, uniform, and skewed distributions   How scaling and normalization techniques are used to ensure all the values in a dataset are  within a common range.   Hands-on practice on data wrangling, both the last few parts in the module and the problem-  solving activities at the end.
