Machine learning (Pass Task- Topic 1)  Probability  Probability is how likely something is to happen. It is expressed as a percentage.  Event: Set of outcomes from a random experiment  Probability can also be defined as likelihood of occurrence of an event.  The probability of an event E occurring is denoted as P(E).  Joint Probability  If two events, A and B are independent then the joint probability is P(AπB) = P(A). P(B)  Conditional Probability  the probability of some event A, given the occurrence of another event B.  Condition probability P(A|B),  P(A|B) = P(AπB)/ P(B)  Bayes Rule  P(A|B) = P(B|A). P(A)/ P(B), when P(B) is not equal to zero.  Random Variable  A random variable is a variable with an unknown value or a function that gives values to each of the results of an experiment. There are two types of random variables: discrete (having specified values) and continuous (any value in a continuous range).  Distributions of random variables  This describes likelihood of various results from a random experiment.  Probability distribution of Discrete random variables are defined using a Probability Mass Functions (PMF). Denoted as π(X).         Probability distribution of a Continuous random variables are defined using Probability Density Functions (PDF). Denoted as f(x).  For all the probability distributions, the probability of each possible value must be non-negative and the sum of probabilities of over all the possible values must be equal to 1.  Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)  Discrete Random Variables - The CDF is the total of the probability of all potential values that are less than or equal to x.  Continuous Random Variables- The CDF is the integral of the PDF up to x.  Some examples of probability distributions include,  Bernoulli Distribution - discrete distribution and defined for a binary random variable  e.g.  distribution over tossing a coin  Uniform Distribution- defined for both discrete and continuous random variables  e.g., Rolling a fair dice  Normal Distribution - defined for continuous random variables. It is s the most common distribution characterized by a bell-shaped curve symmetrical around the data's mean. A uniform distribution has values that are scattered equally over the data's range. In contrast, A skewed distribution is one in which the values are not evenly distributed but are instead concentrated on one side of the range.  If the values are not distributed equally, the algorithm may become biased in favor of some values, which could result in weak performance.  Central Limit Theorem  Regardless of the distribution of the individual random variables, the total of a large number of independent variables with identical distributions tends to be normally distributed.  Data Wrangling  Raw data needs to be cleaned and processed in a methodical way prior to use for analysis and insights. Tasks such as Data cleaning, Data transformation, Data validation, Data formatting, etc. are done through manual and automated process with this step. In simple terms this involves correcting errors, maintaining consistency of formats, locating pointless outliers, combining several datasets etc.       Feature Extraction  It is the method of choosing and extracting important elements from raw data. The aim of feature extraction is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much key information as possible. This could result in increased machine learning model performance and reduction in processing times.  Encoding  When developing an algorithm machine cannot understand the categorical variables related. Therefore, it is important to convert theses categorical values to integers.  There are different encoding techniques such as One-Hot Encodings, Label Encoder, mean encoding, etc.  Ordinal/ Label Encoding  One-Hot Encoding  Scaling  It is transferring the raw data into a similar scale. Algorithms can be affected by the scales of the inputs. Therefore, it is important bring them all to a similar scale so there won’t be any biasness in the input data for the algorithm. There are two main types of scaling. These will bring down the scale of the variables to a value between zero to +/- one.  -  Min-Max Scaling -  Standardization
