  Basic probability concepts.   Random variables (discrete and continuous) and random variable distributions.  Intro to representing images and text documents as data we can use in machine learning. Intro to feature extraction as a step for machine learning.     Encoding – converting the categorical variables of a features into integers.   Scaling & normalisation – converting the values in a dataset into a new range. (For  example, converting all the values into a range between 0-1).    Python techniques for data wrangling, which were applied during the topic 2  programming tasks.
