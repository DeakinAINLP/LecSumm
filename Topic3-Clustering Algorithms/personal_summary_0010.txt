1)In this module we have discussed about the various types of probability and its properties. Joint probability which is defined as the events which are happening together in a same time and space. Conditional probability is defined as happening of one event in an occurrence of another event . Bayes theorem is defined as the event which is actually based on an another event but that event is directly dependent on the other event .(Back in my school days these topics were already thought in my mathematics at grade 12,Iâ€™m not including the formulas but I am aware of them) 2)Random variables which is defined as the outcomes which are generated in a random way .There are two types of random variables which are Discrete random variables and continuous random variables . There are even many types of distribution in random variables such as Bernoulli distribution, Uniform distribution and Normal distribution. 3)Data wrangling which is defined as cleaning up data from large data set and taking out the essential data for analysis and other purposes .Data wrangling is a important process in data science and it plays a vital role in it. 4)Data ,which plays a vital role in  any big company to take some important steps for their company . Our search history ,share history everything is considered as data and which would help the companies to grow . 5)Scaling which is defined as a technique for adjusting the range of independent variables or data characteristics. We use scaling in Machine learning to get accurate and optimal results .Normalization is defined as transforming the data values to the same range to get accurate results in an easy way. 6)We have discussed the important steps in Data wrangling such as Data saving , Data exploration, Data processing , Data distribution and Scaling .
