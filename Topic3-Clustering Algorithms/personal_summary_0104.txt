Machine Learning  Topic 2 review  From the previous topic I gained the basic understanding of Machine Learning. This topic we focused mainly on the statistical part. I learned that in order to work with data containing millions of rows and columns, we need to ﬁrst process them. We do this for making the analysis easier for us. This process of transforming data into a more readable ﬁle is called data wrangling. The modules provided enough insight for the understanding. But the python programs have given me enough idea of how diﬀerent ﬁles can be processed to look for missing data and make the ﬁle readable for further processing. I learned that in order for a machine learning model to work properly and give the best outcomes, we provide the model with features of the data. I learned how features from images and texts can be fed to the model to get desired output. I also got a basic understanding of how to extract features from images and texts.  Since computer can only understand numerical values, therefore the concept of encoding came. I understood how encoding works and through the modules provided I gained enough to understand the diﬀerent types of encoding techniques. For the visualization part, I learned about scaling and normalization. I understood how scaling is important to compare diﬀerent types of data. I was introduced to min-max normalization. Through the python codes provided in the module, I understood the concept practically. I also worked on a diﬀerent dataset provided by our professor and that helped me a lot. Through all the codes provided and the tasks given, I gained more ideas about machine learning. But I learned a li(cid:425)le bit more about python functions through trial-and-error method. I was inquisitive about the change in the output if a small portion of the code was changed. I refer W3school website for python programming. The greater part of learning is from the classes and the workshops.
