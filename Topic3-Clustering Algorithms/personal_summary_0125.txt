We have covered the fields of probability, random variables, data wrangling,  feature extraction, “what is data/signal”, encoding, scaling, normalisation, and statistics in data science topics in the second topic. We have also covered data loading and saving, data exploration, data handling, data processing, data distribution, scaling, and encoding topics in Python. We have used pandas library in order to handle data, sklearn library in order to encode, and matplotlib library in order to plot data.  I have successfully understood the usage of pandas and sklearn libraries, but I couldn’t understand the usage matplotlib library. I also couldn’t solve the 4th part of the pass activity.  While studying the probability topic, I wondered about the relationship between quantum computing, machine learning, and probability. With my limited knowledge of quantum computing, I knew probability is at the center of both quantum and machine learning fields. I asked some questions about these topics to the chatgpt but couldn’t get any satisfying answer. I will deepen my research about this topic in the next topics and when I find notable results, I will also present them as an addition to the assignment.
