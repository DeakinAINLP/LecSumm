1. Main Points of Topic 2  Basic definitions of statistics in a random experiment  Event: a set of outcomes of a random experiment  Probility: the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur  Joint Probility: probability can be defined jointly for more than one event  Conditional Probability: probability of event A, given the occurrence of event B  Bayes Rule: probability of an event A based on event B that is related to A  Random Variables  Discrete Random Variable: countable numbers of values   Probability Mass Functions(PMF)   Cumulative Distribution Function(CDF)  Continuous Random Variable: take values on a infinite continuum   Bernoulli Distribution   Uniform Distribution   Normal Distribution   Central Limit Theorem  Data Wrangling  Definition: process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing a data set to make it  suitable for analysis  Missing Value Replacement - null or missing values can be replace by two methods:  Replace with immediate value, replace with mean or median value of the row  Normalization: a scaling technique used to transform the values of a data set into a  common range in order to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms  Non-numerical Data Encoding   Ordinal Encoder   One-Hot Encoding   Label Encoder
