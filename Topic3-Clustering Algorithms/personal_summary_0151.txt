A range of tasks aimed at refining, modifying, and restructuring datasets to make them more suitable for a comprehensive analysis is known as data wrangling, or data munging. To ensure that data can be utilized for meaningful insights, both manual and automated techniques are used in this multifaceted process.  A variety of operations are performed on the dataset during data wrangling, to improve its quality and usability. A typical example would be the addressing of missing or inaccurate data, inconsistencies, duplicates, and outliers. To achieve a more reliable dataset, data scientists need to identify and correct these anomalies.  Moreover, data wrangling involves converting the data to a standard format that makes it easy to interpret and compare. It may be necessary to convert data types, standardize units of measurement, and align variables across different sources to accomplish this. Researchers can perform reliable cross-analysis using such transformations, which allows them to combine datasets from a variety of sources and come up with more accurate and comprehensive conclusions.  Overall, data processing is a complex and important process in the field of data science. This involves systematic cleansing, transformation, and organization of datasets, ultimately resulting in sophisticated, well-structured datasets that aid in informed analysis and informed decision-making. is generated. Through effective data wrangling, data scientists can unlock the full potential of their data and uncover valuable insights that drive innovation and progress in many areas.  Feature extraction is a fundamental process in machine learning that extracts relevant information from raw data to create a concise and meaningful set of features. In this context, features describe specific aspects or characteristics of data that can provide valuable insight or predictive power related to the variable being analysed.  The purpose of feature extraction is to transform the original data into a form suitable for processing by machine learning algorithms to derive patterns. In its original form, raw data can contain excessive or irrelevant information that can hinder the learning process or cause model failures. By selectively extracting specific features, you can improve your signal-to- noise ratio and focus on the most informative aspects of your data. Feature selection and derivation is based on the underlying problem and the desired outcome of the machine learning task. Depending on the domain and data properties, feature extraction techniques may involve various operations such as mathematical transformations, statistical computations, dimensionality reduction, and domain-specific knowledge.  In machine learning, scaling is an important pre-processing step that converts the values of features in a dataset to a consistent range. Features with different scales or units of measure can have significantly different range of values between features. This mismatch can cause model training problems and impact the performance and interpretability of the resulting model.  Data exploration is a key step in the machine learning pipeline, aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of the dataset before proceeding with model development. The goal is to gain insights that serve as the basis for feature selection, pre-processing, and model design decisions, discover patterns, and identify relationships in the data.  Data encoding: Convert categorical or text data into numeric representations for machine learning models.  Data distribution: Analyse the statistical properties of your data to understand its distribution. B. Mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis.  Data scaling: Convert numerical traits to a consistent scale to ensure fair comparisons and prevent dominance of specific traits.
