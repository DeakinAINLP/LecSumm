Topics Covered in Topic 2    Probability and Statistics basic definitions  Event and sample space of a coin toss  Sample space = {head, tail}; event = {{head}, {tail}}  Event and sample space of a dice roll  Sample space = {1,2,3,4,5,6}; event = {{1},{2},{3},{4},{5},{6}}    Probability, if P(A) is the probability of Event A, then 1 - P(A) is the probability that the event  does not occur. Joint Probability, the probability of two events happening together and is denoted as    P(A and B) or P(A) x P(B)    Conditional Probability, the probability of some event A given the occurrence of another  event B. It is denoted as:  𝑃(𝐴|𝐵) =  𝑃(𝐴 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐵) 𝑃(𝐵)  𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑑 𝑃(𝐵)    Bayes Rules, the probability of an event A based on another event B that is related to A  It is denoted as:  𝑃(𝐴|𝐵) =  𝑃(𝐵|𝐴) 𝑃(𝐴) 𝑃(𝐵)  𝑖𝑛 𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑐ℎ 𝑃(𝐵) ≠ 0    Random variables, a variable whose possible values are the generated outcomes of a random  phenomenon.  -  Discrete random variables have a countable number of values. i.e. face of a dice  It is defined using Probability Mass Functions(PMF).  -  Continuous random variable can take values on an infinite continuum. i.e. time to failure  It is defined using Probability Density Functions (PDF)    Distribution of random variables  -  Probability distribution : a function that links each outcome of a statistical experiment with its probability of occurrence  -  Bernoulli distribution: a discrete distribution defined for a binary random variable with  values X=0 and X=1 -  Uniform distribution -  Normal distribution is defined for continuous random variables    Central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean and standard deviation  and take sufficiently large random samples from the existing population, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.    Data wrangling or data munging, is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing a    dataset to make it suitable for analysis. Image as data concept, by dividing the image into smaller blocks and computing feature of choice (i.e. average color, brightness, shapes)    Text data representation, using a bag of words to represent text that describes the occurrence of words feeding a document. By turning the words into vectors then into feature matrix, two documents can be compared.    Scaling, the process of converting a set of values to a new range of values   Normalization, scaling technique used to transform the values of a dataset into a common  range.
