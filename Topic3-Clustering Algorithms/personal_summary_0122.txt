The main points that were covered this topic are some more basic knowledge behind  machine learning. This includes some informa(cid:415)on that scratches the surface about how images and documents are prepared to be entered into a machine learning algorithm. It also has some informa(cid:415)on about probability, teaching the basics of probability, and then also ge(cid:427)ng into more advanced topics such as the various distribu(cid:415)on types. Then it also goes into some basics about data wrangling and why it is important, for our machine learning algorithms.
