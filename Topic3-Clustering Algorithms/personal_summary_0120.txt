 This topic's topics included various methods for importing, cleaning, and  standardizing data, as well as processes for summarizing data and visualization  for analysis. This included an introduction to text and image data processing,  converting categorical data to numerical form for fitting into machine learning  algorithms, visualizing data distribution using various visualization techniques, as  well as data summarization such as mean, median, and standard deviation, and  cleaning data using appropriate data cleaning techniques based on the presence  of null values and outliers. Several strategies for scaling and standardizing data  were also explored in order to improve machine learning outputs.  Several Python libraries and methods were implemented throughout the  workshops and task 2 to achieve all of the above data handling methods.
