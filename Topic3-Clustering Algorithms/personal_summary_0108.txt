 In  this  topic  mainly  cover  probability.  I  have  learned  and  have  a  better  understanding  of different probabilities including joint  probability, conditional  probability, Bayesian rule and random variable.  Joint probability – Refers to the probability of two or more events occurring together.  Conditional probability – Refers to the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.  Bayes  rule  –  Describe  the  relationship  between  conditional  probabilities.  For  example  The probability of A given B can be calculated using the conditional probability of B given A and the prior probability of A and B.  Random variable - Is a concept used to describe variables whose values are subject to random.  Also, it included data wrangling. Data wrangling means pre-processing of cleaning the data to transform  or  integrate.  The  main  reason  is  to  make  sure  the  data  is  suitable  and  make  it consistent for analysis.
