  Probability  random variable is a function that assigns probabilities to events in a random experiment. It can have discrete values, like faces of some dice, or continuous values, like height of a person. The function maps each value to a specific outcome, and assigns a probability to each possible outcome of the experiment.    distribution  The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution for a binary random variable with values 0 and 1, often denoted as p and 1-p. The uniform distribution can be defined for both discrete and continuous random variables, with equal probability assigned to each possible outcome. Rolling a fair dice is an example of a uniform distribution in a discrete space.    python(NumPy, pandas, scikitlearn)  on csv file arrange data distribution and specific data and fixing null values.    normalisation(min-max and encoding)  encoding using sklearn and label encoder, while minmax scale and compare to difference between before scale and after scale.
