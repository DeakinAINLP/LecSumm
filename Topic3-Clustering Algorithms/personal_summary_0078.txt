 The amount of content for this topic was quite a lot to get through. The major focus for this topic was around data wrangling, some foundational data science concepts, and some information about statistics. The information about statistics included probability and Bayesian decision making. There are several types of random variables which can be discrete or continuous. There are different types of distributions that data can be arranged in â€“ so far, much of this information I learned in the unit SIT220 Data Wrangling. The information about how feature extraction can take place on an image was particular fascinating. The remaining topics covered some topic of data wrangling or another.  Consumed learning resources:  - -  Lecture material and Deakin Sync Unit Site learning materials. The provided links regarding facial recognition and Bayesian decision making.  One major reflection that stood out to me while reflecting on this knowledge in relation to machine learning is that it has mathematical modelling at its root. I already felt that this may be the case, however that idea is solidified now.
