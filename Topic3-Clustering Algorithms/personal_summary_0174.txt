Summary:   Random variables are generated by random phenomenon  Two types of random variables are discrete and continuous random variables  Discrete random variables are defined by probability mass function  Continuous random variables are defined by probability density function  Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution with binary random variables  Uniform distribution is used for both discrete and continuous random variables  Normal distribution is used for continuous random variables  Central limit theorem states that large random samples from a population exhibit normal  distribution   Data wrangling is the cleaning, transforming and organising of datasets  Computers only understand numbers and so data must be transformed into numbers Scaling and normalising helps to make data more suitable for machine analysis   Reading this topicâ€™s content helped me refresh on content I had previously learned such as probability but also taught me new content such as Bayes theorem and how to wrangle data using python. I feel I have learned a lot of practical knowledge for wrangling data using python and using modules such as pandas and sci kit.
