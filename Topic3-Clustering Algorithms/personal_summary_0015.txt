Topic two covered a brief review of statistics and probability, and then went into depth about data wrangling. With regards to statistics and probability, we reflected on the basic concepts of probability, explored random variables, both discrete and continuous and finally looked at a few forms of distribution. We then dived into the process of manipulating  datasets  into  more  suitable  forms,  otherwise  known  as  data  wrangling.  We  touched  on  various techniques to adjust faulty or incomplete data, how to combine and convert datasets, and the normalisation process. Python was utilised to explain and display each process.
