 -  Understand mathemaIcal and staIsIcal deÔ¨ÅniIons and formulaIon for machine learning algorithms including a random experiment, event, and probability (joint probability, condiIonal probability, and Bayes rule). -  Understand random variable, its two main types (discrete random variable, and conInuous random variable), and its most important distribuIons including Normal distribuIon, Bernoulli distribuIon, Uniform distribuIon, and central limit theorem. Learn about the process of data wrangling, how it extracts features, how a model is created, how text/image/signal data is represented, and the way it is encoding, scaling, and normalising.  -  -  Apply Python programming, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy to solve those  staIsIcal problems.
