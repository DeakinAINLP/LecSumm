Statistics: Basic Definitions  Joint probability: If two events, A and B are independent then the joint probability is P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)  Conditional probability:  Bayes rule: Bayes rule describes the probability of an event A based on another event B that is  related to A –  Random Variables Discrete Variables – Probability Mass Functions (PMF): Assigns probability to each possible value  as…  i.e., the probability of getting each side of a dice is 1/6.  Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) gives cumulative probability as  Continuous Variables – Probability Density Functions (PDF): assigns a probability to a range of  values of the random variable  Bernoulli Distribution  Uniform Distribution  Normal Distribution  Central Limit Theorem i.e., larger population more normally distributed  Feature Extraction In order to have a computer identify the qualities of the content of an image, the image must be represented as a numerical vector of features. E.g., dividing the image into smaller blocks and defining features such as, colour average, shapes present, texture variation, radiance or brightness.  Normalisation Scaling technique to transform values of a dataset into a common range.
