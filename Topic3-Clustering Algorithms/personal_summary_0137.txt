Probability is all about the chances of something happening. In machine learning, we use it to create models that can guess what might happen, even if things are kind of up in the air. Random variables are just variables that can switch up their value based on whatever random thing  happens  next.  And  that's  important  in  machine  learning  because  it  helps  us  make  predictions based on data we've got. Data wrangling is basically just cleaning and fixing up our data so we can use it to make our models. It's a big deal in machine learning because we need our data to be as accurate as possible to make our models really work. Images are a kind of data too, and we can use them to figure out what patterns or objects are hiding in them. The bag of words model is just a way of counting how many times each word shows up in a piece of text, and that helps us understand what the text is all about.  Encoding is a way to turn data that's just words or categories into numbers, so our machine learning models can understand it. Different kinds of data need different models, and we can use things like normal or skewed distributions to figure out how to make the right model. And we need to scale our data so it's all on the same level and we can get the best results from our machine learning models. Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn are some tools we can use to make sure our data is ready for our models. Understanding all this stuff is key to making our machine learning models the best they can be, so we can use them to do all sorts of cool stuff, like natural language processing, computer vision, and more.
