This topic provided a high-level review of probability, including joint, conditional and Bayes rule. We covered variables and the distributions of random variables, the Bernoulli, uniform and normal distribution.  The second part of the topic was focused on explaining how we can transform non numerical data into a format that can be utilized for training in a machine learning algorithm. We looked at the representation of images as data, text as data and how to utilize feature extraction for creating a model.  We covered techniques such as feature encoding, scaling and normalization in order to transform values in a way that they will not introduce bias in an ML algorithm.  The third part of the topic focused on the Python programming language and the use of the NumPy and Pandas libraries and how they can be used to solve the statistics topics that we covered including loading, exploring and wrangling data.
