  Topic 2 Summary Feature Vectors:  Euclidean Distance  =   √(𝑥11 − 𝑥21)2 +   (𝑥12 − 𝑥22)2 +   (𝑥1𝑛 − 𝑥2𝑛)2  Feature Matrix    Stacking of multiple feature vectors as instances in a dataset   A matrix is 2 dimensional with feature vectors as columns and rows are the data points.  Probabity and Random Experiment    It is an experiment or a process for which the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.  o  E.g toss of a coin or roll of a dice   Event: set of outcomes of a random experiment.   Sample space (Ω) is the available options in an event.  o  E.g. a coin has {head, tail}    Probability is the measure of the likelihood that and event will occur and it is quantified as a  number between 0 and 1.  o  P (A) : Probability of an event occuring o  Probability of an event not occurring  𝑃(𝐴̅) = 1 − 𝑃(𝐴)    Joint Probability is when more than one independent event of a random experiment.  𝑃 (𝐴 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐵) =  𝑃(𝐴) ∗ 𝑃(𝐵)    Conditional Probability is  the probability of some event A, given the occurrence of another  event B  𝑃 (𝐴|𝐵) =  𝑃 (𝐴 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐵) 𝑃(𝐵)  𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑃(𝐵)   ≠ 0    Byes Rule describes the probability of an event A based on another event B that is related to  A.  𝑃 (𝐴|𝐵) =  𝑃 (𝐵|𝐴)𝑃(𝐴) 𝑃(𝐵)  𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑃(𝐵)   ≠ 0          Random Variable    Is a variable whose possible values are the generated outcomes of a random phenomenon; OR Is a function that can assign probabilities to events of interest in a random experiment.     Types of Random variables:  o  Discrete Random Variable:  countable numbers of values  ▪ ▪  defined using Probability Mass Functions (PMF) / ∏(x)  o  Continuous Random Variable:  takes a infinite continuum of numbers  ▪ ▪  defined using Probability Density Functions (PDF) / f(x)    Probability Distribution  o  Is a function that links each outcome of a statistical experiment with its probability of occurrence  o  Types of the probability distribution  ▪  Bernoulli Distribution (Discrete Binary distribution with values x = 0 and x =  1)  ▪  Uniformed Distribution (can be bothe discrete and continuous) ▪  Normal Distribution (Continuous only and follows the Central Limit Theorem  Data Wrangling    Cleaning, transforming and organising a dataset.   Missing value replacement (essential) o  Methods to replace:  ▪  With immediate value ▪  With mean or median value of the variable.    Scaling or normalisation  Is a scaling technique use to transform the values of a dataset into a common range.  o o  Done to improve performance of machine learning. o  Types of normalisation  ▪  Min-max normalisation    Non-numerical data encoding is to help variables/features that contain categorical values  machin understandable.  o  Techniques of encoding:  ▪  Ordinal Encoding / OrdinalEncoder / Label Encodings    Assigns a integer values to each unique category   Suitable for variables that has ranking or order   Normally start with integers from zero (0) onwards.  ▪  One-Hot Encodings    Assigns a set of binary values to each unique category   E.g. Category variable = {male, female} = {(0,1),(1,0)}   Suitable for variables that has no order or rank   Limitations: it creates redundancies.
