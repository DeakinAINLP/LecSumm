In this topic, the basic concepts which are studied in topic 1 were broadly explained. They are,    Vectors and basic vector operations   Matrices and matrix operations   Basic concepts of probability   Python programing  Since statistics plays a major role in machine learning, it is important to learn basics of probability such as random experiments, events, probability, joint probability, conditional probability and bayes rules. Examples:  Probability of event A is denoted as P(A)  Joint probability P(A and B)=P(A).P(B)  Random variables are generated with the outcome of a random phenomenon. There are two types of random variables: Discreate random variable and Continuous Random Variable.  Discreate  random  variable  can  be  defined  using  probability  mass  function.  It  includes  countable number of values while continuous random variable can be defined using probability density function. Data wrangling is the most important part of topic 2. It is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing  a  dataset  to  make  it  suitable  for  analysis.  We  can  make  the  computer  to  analyze  and categorize images. Since computers can only understand numbers, words; images and ideas must be transformed into numbers.  In this topic, I learnt how to load a dataset to python and do some process for the data such as, finding the missing values of data and full those missing values with most appropriate numbers. That means we can add mean or median to the missing values  by finding out whether the data distribution is symmetric  or  skewed.  Also,  we  can  encode  categorical  variables  using  appropriate  encoding approaches. After all, we can save the new organized data file without opening in physically and make them appropriate for the further analysis.  In this topic also, I used W3school website to study and practice python codes.
