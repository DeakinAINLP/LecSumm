Topic 2 provided a solid synopsis and refresher on Matrix mathematical probability principles and application and manipulation large datasets in the python programming environment.  This topic provided further examples of how objects such as images can be broken down into features to allow for a numeric evaluation of characteristics. This data science aspect of machine learning also referenced methodologies associated with manipulating and framing the data to enhance the ability to characterise and appropriately weight the data of features in relation to other features.  As data is best evaluated in numeric terms, a method of encoding nonnumeric data was shown that could be applied.  The the appropriate syntax for wrangling unorganised data to achieve desired organised dataset was most interesting with several different methodologies available, including methods of “cleaning up” missed entries to avoid errors in the learning outputs.
