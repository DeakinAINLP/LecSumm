Data Wrangling  Learning Report  Throughout  the  second  topic,  a  wide  variety  of  subjects  related  to machine  learning,  along  with  fundamental  statistical  concepts,  was discussed.  Some  of  the  notable  points  that  were  explored  during  the second topic are:  l Basic Statistics: A fairly strong knowledge of statistics is required in machine learning. Topic two reviews basic statistical concepts such as random variables, event, probability, Bayes theorem and so on.  Data Wrangling: Real world data is often untidy and messy. Data cleaning is suitable for analysis. Some common data cleaning task include correcting erroneous data types, handling missing values, removing outlier and so on.  Data Pre-processing: The goal of data wrangling is to have a tidy dataset structure such that each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.  Another concept explored during the second topic is how text data are represented numerically.  Non-Numerical Features: Machine learning models can only be trained with numeric data. Therefore, datasets containing categorical features are encoded using techniques such as OrdinalEncoder, LabelEncoder and so on.  Scaling: Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic regression  and neural networks assume normal distribution.  Hence, datasets which are out of scale need to be re-scaled before these algorithms are applied on them.Popular re-scaling techniques include standardization and min-max normalization.
