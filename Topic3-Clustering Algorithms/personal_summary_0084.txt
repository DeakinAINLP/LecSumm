 This topic’s content began with an introduction to probability. After reading through the content I felt that I needed to refresh my memory on this topic, and found a YouTube series on probability basics that was incredibly helpful for this. After doing this I revisited the unit material and found it much easier to understand. I found it especially helpful in understanding the notations of probability distributions, which are functions that describe the possible values of a random variable, and the probability of them occurring.  Data wrangling was the main focus of this topic’s content. Data wrangling is the process of preparing a raw data set for analysis, and can be done both manually and automatically by cleaning, transforming and organising the data.  Machine learning algorithms need to be fed data organised into a set of features, or feature matrix. This is because computers can only understand numbers, so data in the form of images or text first needs to be represented as number before it can be classified. Features with categorical values need to be encoded to integer values.  Scaling is a way of transforming the values of a data set so that is fits within a specific range, and normalisation is a type of scaling in which the distribution of the data is transformed.  The learning resources then continue to give examples of these data wrangling steps and techniques in Python. These include creating random variables, using Pandas to work with dataframes, data processing, distribution and scaling.
