Data collection, analysis, and interpretation are all covered by the discipline of statistics, which also includes the idea of random variables. The process of transforming raw data into an analytically useful format is known as data wrangling. By developing an algorithm that processes the numerical aspects of the image, it is possible to teach machines to analyse and classify images. Signals represent and transmit information in a variety of applications and can be categorised into distinct categories, whereas data is any information in structured or unstructured formats utilised for decision-making. Using mathematical and computer methods, signal processing entails the analysis, synthesis, and manipulation of signals.
