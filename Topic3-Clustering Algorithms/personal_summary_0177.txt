 This topic's topics cover a range of mathematical and programming concepts. I went through some of the fundamental ideas in statistics, such mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. I gained knowledge of random variables and how they may be applied to simulate data uncertainty. In my investigation, I looked at probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, and how they might be applied to modelling actual data. I gained knowledge about data cleaning and transformation methods, including how to handle missing data and different data formats. I looked at methods for handling and interpreting picture data as well as how images might be represented as data. I gained knowledge of various text data representation methods, such as word embeddings and bag-of-words. I discovered how to choose key characteristics for analysis and reduce the dimensionality of data using feature extraction techniques.
