This  topic  I  learned  about  some  mathematic  concepts  that  are  used  in  data  normalization  like probability (joined and conditional), statistics, etc. In statistics I covered different types of distributions like normal, uniform and Bernoulli.  After  that  I  covered  data  wrangling  steps  that  include  handling  missing  values,  removing  outliers, normalization,  etc.  Then  image  and  text-based  data  is  covered  and  how  data is  distinguished  from signal in terms of analytics. A new concept of feature extraction is covered where instead of having pre-defined attributes I must learn to extract features from results like facial recognitions.  Reading List This topic covers the mathematics involved in statistics and probability and its implementation in data wrangling for handling missing values, normalizing data and most importantly removing outliers. The math concepts are covered from 2.1 to 2.3 and from there we dive into data representations like image and text and difference between data & signal (2.4 to 2.8). Feature extraction and its application (facial recognition) is covered in 2.5.  From 2.9 to 2.11 we cover encoding and distribution techniques to tackle string type data attributes, scaling  and  normalization  of  data  for  interpretation  and  standardization  &  finding  aggregates  like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.  Python libraries involved this topic are pandas for reading csv data files, scipy for calculating statistic- based aggregates, matplotlib for plotting and using LabelEncoder function from sklearn for encoding techniques.
