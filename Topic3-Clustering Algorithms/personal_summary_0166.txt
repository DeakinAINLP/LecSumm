Summarise the main points that is covered in this topic.  Joint Probability: If two events, A and B are independent then the  joint probability is P(A and B) = P(A) P(B)  Conditional Probability: the probability of some event A given the  occurrence of another event B, P(A|B) = P(A and B)/ P(B), P(B) != 0  Bayes Rule: Bayes rule describes the probability of an event A based on  another event B that is related to A,  P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/ P(B), P(B and A) = P(B|A)P(A) and P(B) !=0
