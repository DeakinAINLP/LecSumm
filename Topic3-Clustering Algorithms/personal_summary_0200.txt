Summary:  Probability is a kind of mathematics in machine learning algorithms, Probability distribution is a method used to describe the probability of the possible value of a random variable. In machine learning, probability distributions are used to establish and evaluate models. A random variable has a discrete random variable and continuous random variable, the discrete random variable is refer to limit or unlimited discontinuous value, the continuous random variable is refer to the unlimited continuous value.  Data wrangling includes:  Data identification: correcting the error or repeat data, makes accurate data.  Converting data: includes operations such as encoding, standardizing, and scaling data.  Data combination: multiple data combine to be a dataset, used for analysis and modelling.  Normalizing the data: reducing a large dataset to a smaller dataset to reduce the computational complexity of data analysis and modelling.  Feature extraction: extracting features related to analysis or modelling from raw data to facilitate the application of machine learning algorithms.  Reflection:  The most important I learned are statistics and data wrangling. Statistics mathematics are probability and random variable, which are related to the math I have learned, the probability is a mathematics concept and mean something happens between 0 to 1, the random distribution used to describe the probability of the possible value of a random variable. Learning statistics and data wrangling makes understanding the data processing in machine learning.
