This topic we were introduced to statistics definitions and data wrangling.  Random experiment – process for which the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty  Event – Set of outcomes of a random experiment  Joint probability – Probability of multiple events  Conditional Probability – Probability of event A, given the occurrence of event B–  Data wrangling – Process of cleaning, transforming and organizing a dataset to make it suitable for analysis  Encoding – The process of giving features with categorical values a quantitative equivalent  Scaling – The process of converting a set of values toa new range of values  Normalisation – A scaling technique to transform values to a common range of 0 – 1  The content of this topic was effective in preparing us for working with datasets. The process of data wrangling will be important for ensuring the usability and accuracy of our datasets. I found the exercises to be productive in familiarising myself with dataframes and the pandas library.
