 Topic -2 gave a details  overview of  mathematical  operations used in  machine learning and  the  importance and steps of performing data wrangling. Some of the important points are listed below:  1)  Some  of  the  basic  mathematical  concepts  required  while  performing  machine  learning  covers probability concepts. These are:  a.  Random experiment: A random experiment is an experiment where the outcome is  uncertain.  b.  Event: An event is a subset of the possible outcomes of a random experiment. In  machine learning, events can represent things like a particular class label for a data  point, or a certain level of accuracy on a task.  c.  Probability: In machine learning, probabilities are often used to model uncertainty  in predictions or to estimate the likelihood of certain outcomes.  d.  Joint probability: The joint probabilities are often used to model the relationship  between different features or variables.  e.  Conditional  probability:  In  machine  learning,  conditional  probabilities  are  often  used to model the relationship between features and class labels.  f.  Bayes rule: Bayes rule is often used to update beliefs about a hypothesis or model  based on new data or evidence.  g.  A random  variable is  a variable whose value is  determined by the outcome of a  random experiment.  i.  Discrete random variables: Discrete random variables take on a countable  number of values.    ii.  Continuous  random  variables:  Continuous  random  variables  take  on  an  infinite number of possible values within a given range.  h.  In probability theory, a distribution is used to model and reason about uncertainty  in data and predictions. Some of the important distributions are:  i.  Bernoulli distribution: The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution  that models binary data [3]. It has a single parameter, p, which represents  the probability of the event being modeled.  ii.  Normal  distribution:  The  normal  distribution  is  a  continuous  distribution  that is often used to model real-valued data[5]. It has two parameters, mean  (mu)  and  standard  deviation  (sigma),  which  determine  the  shape  of  the  distribution.  iii.  Uniform distribution: The uniform distribution is a continuous probability  distribution that describes a random variable that is equally likely to take on  any value within a certain range [4].  2)  Data  wrangling,  also  known  as  data  munging  or  data  cleaning,  is  the  process  of  transforming  and  preparing  raw  data  into  a  format  that  is  suitable  for  analysis  [6].  It  involves a series of steps to clean, transform, and restructure data so that it can be used  effectively for modeling and analysis.  a.  Data loading and saving: This step involves reading in the data from its original  source,  such  as  a  file  or  a  database,  and  saving  it  in  a  format  that  can  be  easily  manipulated  by  software  tools.  This  may  involve  loading  data  into  a  data  management system, such as a database, or converting it into a structured format,  such as CSV or JSON.  b.  Data exploration: This step involves examining the data to gain an understanding  of its content, structure, and quality [8].  c.  Data processing: This step involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data  for analysis.  d.  Data distribution: This step involves examining the distribution of the data, such as  its mean, variance, and range, to gain an understanding of its characteristics [9].  This may involve visualizing data distributions using histograms, density plots, or  box plots.  e.  Scaling: This step involves rescaling or normalizing the data to facilitate modeling  or analysis. This may involve standardizing data distributions to have a mean of  zero and a standard deviation of one, or scaling data to a specific range, such as  between zero and one [10].
