 The topics that were covered during topic 2 are Statistics in which the basics of probability was covered, discrete random variables, continuous random variables, distribution of random variables, Data Wrangling, Text data representation, Image data, Feature extraction. Then, Encoding and Distribution, Scaling and Normalisation, Data exploration topics were covered.  I referred to the unit site contents for learning the topics that were covered in the topic 2 along with the external video links provided.  The learning journey started with the basics of probability along with Bayes rule. Then, I acquired knowledge about discrete random variables, continuous random variables, distribution of random variables like Bernoulli distribution, Uniform distribution, and Normal distribution. I gained an idea on what is Data Wrangling is about, and the process involved in it. Then, I got an overview of how the data can be in the form of images also, then how to represent the text data numerically using machine learning algorithms. I gathered knowledge about feature extraction which is one of the key steps in machine learning. Then, learnt about Encoding and Distribution in which got a brief about some of the encoding techniques involving categorical values like OrdinalEncoder, One-Hot Encodings, and LabelEncoder and the way the data values in a dataset are getting distributed. Later, I learnt What is Scaling which is the process of converting set of values to a new range of values and also learnt about the normalisation which is a scaling technique used to transform the data values into a common range. Then, I acquired knowledge on data exploration using python commands like describe(), info() etc. along with how to find and replace the missing values in a dataset. Finally,  categorical value encoding using LabelEncoder technique, data distribution along with min-max scaling was learnt.
