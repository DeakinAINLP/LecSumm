In the second topic of this unit, I am able to understand the concepts of data wrangling, and the tasks involved such as handling incomplete data, correcting errors and inconsistencies and understanding the process of normalizing data, through using a specific formula.  Through this, I am able to utilise my understanding of data wrangling to identify and then fill the missing entries from the dataset given to me, can encode categorical variables and can apply scaling on a range of features, while also identifying differences between the default and scaled features, done through the programming language of python. This is done with the added help of tutorials provided within the module.  Overall, I believe that I have learnt upon these concepts well despite a rough start, but the assistance of the content provided within the module had proven to be helpful to me when completing this pass task.
