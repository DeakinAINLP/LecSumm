 ➢  Mathematics is base for Machine learning, which underlies in every  decision, iteration & output.  ➢  Probability plays a crucial role in ML’s algorithms which has joint,  conditional etc.  ➢  Baye’s rule or theorem also known as formula for the probability of  causes.  ➢  Random variables & it’s type, with the formulas like discrete that have countable number of values & Continuous that can take in infinite continumm.  ➢  Distribution of Random variables which connects every outcome of a  statistical experiment with its probability occurrence.  ➢  Bernoulli distribution, Uniform Distribution, Normal distribution, out of these normal is popular because of its usage in plenty of natural phenomena.  ➢  Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is the process of  cleaning, transforming, and organizing a dataset to make it suitable for analysis.  ➢  Feature extraction the process of transforming raw data into  numerical features that can be processed while preserving the information in the original data set..It also involves two-step process which starts from Computers understand numbers , creation of model ➢  Text data representation is highly important as ML requires data to be  described as features.  ➢  Enconding  is used to convert to integer values & it is of 3 type such as  OrdinalEncoder, One-Hot Encodings, and LabelEncoder.  ➢  Distribution which tells the way data is distributed & specified with  some values  ➢  scaling refers to the process of converting a set of values to a new range of values & normalization which is a scaling technique to transform values into common range.  ➢  How to load a data using pandas dataframe, data exploration, Data  descriptions such as mean, std etc.
