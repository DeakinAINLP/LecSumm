Feature Vectors  The vector space model is a representation of a set of documents as vectors. It is a fundamental step in information retrieval operations. Text data is represented as feature vectors.  Vectors and Basic Vector Operations  Feature Matrix  If we stack feature vectors as a matrix, we get what is known as a feature matrix. This can be used to create a vocabulary of features for all the instances in the dataset.  Matrices and Matrix Operations  Basic Concept of Probability  In probability, an event is defined as a set of outcomes of a random experiment (eg. rolling dice, tossing a coin). The probability of an event is a measure of the likelihood that the event will occur. Probability is a number between 0 and 1. The probability that an event A will occur is denoted by P(A). The probability that an event will not occur is 1 - P(A) .  Joint Probability  The probability of two events A and B can be defined jointly, denoted by P(A and B). If the two events are independent, the probability of P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B).  Conditional Probability  The conditional probability is the probability of event A, given the occurrence of another event B.  The probability of A given be is denoted as P(A|B).  Bayes Rule  Bayes rule is a mathematical rule explaining how you should change your existing beliefs in light of new occurrences. It is the essence of most Bayesian approaches. Bayes rule describes the probability of event A, based on another event B that is related to A.  Data Wrangling  Data wrangling is the procedure of acquiring, analysing, and manipulating raw data into a suitable format for faster processing and evaluation. Data wrangling can be divided into the following section:  ÔÇ∑  Data loading and saving ÔÇ∑  Data exploration ÔÇ∑  Data processing, such as missing value handling, encoding categorical values ÔÇ∑  Data distribution ÔÇ∑  Scaling ÔÇ∑  Summarizing and aggregating data  Python is used to deal with missing or invalid data.  Object data type consumes more memory than floating point, so if you are storing an integer just use data type float.  Sklearn encoder ‚Äì encode non-numeric data such as labels into numeric format  Plot data distributions using matplotlib  Df.copy  is used to copy original data frame.  Standardising data distributions using  Scale or normalization of the dataset.  Non-numeric data encoding  This is when categorical data is encoded into numerical data so it can be fed into a model.  Discrete Random Variables  A discrete random variable is characterized by a countable number of values (such as faces of a die, emails received etc..)  Defined using probability mass functions or PMF  The PMF assigns a probability to each discrete value, the sum of these equals 1    Cumulative Distribution Function  The cumulative distribution function or (CDF) finds the cumulative probability associated with a function. It is discontinuous and constant between each point.  Continuous Random Variables  A continuous random variable can include values on an infinite continuum (I.e. Height of a person, time to failure.)  Python programming: using different modules and packages.  We are quantifying the outcomes of a random process.  Distributions of Random Variables  Another way to explain probability distributions: They are functions that link each outcome of a statistical experiment with it‚Äôs probability.  Important Probability Distributions  Bernoulli Distribution ‚Äì Used for binary random variables (ie. X = 0 and X=1)  Uniform Distribution ‚Äì Can be used for discrete and continuous random variables. Eg. Rolling a fair die follows a fair distribution.        Normal Distribution - Can be defined for continuous random values. Most popular distribution. Many natural phenomena approximately follow a normal distribution.  Central Limit Theorem  Central Limit Theorem states that if a population has mean ùúá and standard deviation ùúé , taking a large enough sample from the population, we will be left with a sample that is normally distributed.  Images as Data  How do we put images into a computer friendly format so that we can use them as data in a model? How do we teach an ML model to make decisions from images?  The first step is to find features that can be represented as numbers. If the image is broken down into features, that are represented as numerical vectors, this can be understood by a computer. First we divide the image into smaller blocks, and then find the features of each block.  Features can include color average across the block, shapes, lines, curves, textures such as light/dark variation, radiance and brightness.  Then from these blocks, statistics can be calculated to represent the image.  Feature Extraction is a key step of Machine Learning. Each feature contains information about the target variable. We must find features that can be represented in terms of numbers.  Ted Talk ‚Äì Your Data is Your Currency  Advertising ban in Sau Paulo was beneficial ‚Äì information overload era.
