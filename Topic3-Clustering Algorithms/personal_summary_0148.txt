Probability  Probability is a way to gauge how likely something is to happen. It is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 denotes the absence of a possibility and 1 denotes the existence of one.  You must know both the total number of potential outcomes and the number of favourable possibilities  in  order  to  compute  probability.  The  ratio  between  the  number  of  favourable outcomes  and  the  total  number  of  potential  outcomes  then  provides  the  probability  of  an occurrence.  There is only one good result (rolling a 1) out of six potential outcomes, hence the chance of rolling a 1 on a fair six-sided die is 1/6. (Rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).  Several  disciplines,  including  mathematics,  statistics,  physics,  engineering,  and  finance  all depend on the idea of probability. It is used to simulate unpredictable occurrences and produce future projections based on historical data. When there is ambiguity, probability is also utilised to assess risk and make judgements.  Random Variables  A capital letter, such as X or Y, is often used to signify a random variable, which is a variable whose value is susceptible to chance or randomness. Random variables are used in probability theory and statistics to describe unpredictable events or circumstances where the result is not known beforehand.  Random variables come in two varieties:  Countable numbers of different values are the only ones that discrete random variables may assume. A discrete random variable, like the proportion of heads in ten coin flips, can only have values between 0 and 10. The number of pupils in a class, the volume of automobile traffic in a particular hour, or the quantity of red marbles in a bag are all instances of discrete random variables.  Random variables known as "continuous random variables" are those that have an unlimited range of values. Examples of continuous random variables are a person's height or the length of time it takes for a light bulb to burn out. A room's temperature, a car's speed, or an object's weight are some further examples.  Since they need distinct mathematical models and statistical methods for analysis, it is crucial to distinguish between these two categories of random variables.  Probability Distribution  The possibility of various outcomes in a random event is described by a probability distribution, which  is  a  function.  The  potential  values  that  a  random  variable  could  have  are  given probability. In other words, a probability distribution provides us with information about the likelihood that a specific value of a random variable will occur.  There are several kinds of probability distributions, however the following are the most typical ones:  Discrete probability distributions:  These are probability distributions for discrete random variables, whose potential values can be  counted  and  are  either  finite  or  infinite  but  can  be  counted.  The  geometric  distribution, Poisson distribution, and binomial distribution are a few examples.  Continuous probability distributions:  These  are  probability  distributions  for  continuous  random  variables,  where  the  range  of potential values is unbounded and infinite. The uniform distribution, exponential distribution, and normal distribution are a few examples.  Joint probability distributions:  These probability distributions for two or more random variables provide probabilities to all conceivable  combinations  of  the  variables'  values.  The  copula  distribution,  multinomial distribution, and bivariate normal distribution are a few examples.  Conditional probability distributions:  These  probability  distributions,  known  as  conditional  probability  distributions,  express  the likelihood  of  an  occurrence  in  the  presence  of  another  event.  The  conditional  Poisson distribution, the conditional normal distribution, and the conditional binomial distribution are a few examples.  The  kind  of  random  variable  and  the  issue  under  investigation  determine  the  probability distribution to be used. It's crucial to comprehend and use probability distributions in many disciplines, including statistics, physics, economics, and engineering, to name a few.  Data Wrangling:  The act of changing and preparing raw data into a format that is appropriate for analysis is known as data wrangling, sometimes known as data cleaning or data preparation. Before being utilised for analysis, the data must be checked for accuracy, consistency, and completeness.  Typically, there are numerous phases involved in data wrangling, including:  Data  collection  is  the  process  of  gathering  data  from  many  sources,  including  websites, spreadsheets, and databases.  Cleaning the data means removing mistakes, discrepancies, and missing numbers.  Data transformation:  The process of modifying the data's kind or structuring it so that it is acceptable for analysis.  Data integration:  Data integration is the process of combining different datasets from different sources.  Data reduction:  Data reduction is the process of choosing pertinent variables or observations to reduce the size of the dataset.  Data normalisation:   Data normalisation is the process of scaling data so that it may be compared across various variables or units of measurement.  Although it can be a time-consuming and difficult procedure, data wrangling is necessary for accurate and trustworthy analysis. The outcomes of data analysis may be deceptive or even erroneous if the data are not properly prepared. Thus every project involving data science or machine learning needs to include data wrangling as a crucial stage.  Data Wrangling Activities in Python:  Data wrangling activities may be carried out in Python utilising a variety of tools and packages, such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy. Here are a few typical Python data wrangling operations:    Data cleaning is locating and eliminating mistakes, discrepancies, and missing values from the data. A DataFrame can have missing values that can be removed or replaced using the.dropna() and.fillna() methods from the Pandas library.    Transforming data into an analytically-friendly format is known as data transformation. The  Pandas  library  has  functions  like  .apply()  that  let  you  apply  a  function  to  each element in a DataFrame, while the NumPy library has capabilities like .astype() that let you modify the data type of a NumPy array.    Data integration is the process of merging data from several sources into one dataset. like.concat()  library  offers  operations  the  Pandas  To  combine  DataFrames, and.merge().    Data reduction entails choosing pertinent variables or observations to whittle down the dataset's size. To choose specific rows and columns from a DataFrame, use the.loc[] and.iloc[] methods in the Pandas library.    Data normalisation is scaling the data to ensure consistency across various variables or measurement  units.  Functions  like  zscore()  from  the  SciPy  package  are  available  to normalise the data.    These are only a few instances of data manipulation techniques used in Python. For data  wrangling,  a  wide  range  of  additional  features  and  programmes  are  accessible, depending on the particular requirements of the project.
