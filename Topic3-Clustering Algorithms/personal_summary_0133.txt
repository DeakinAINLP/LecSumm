 In this task, I have performed several data wrangling techniques that improve on the data presented. In machine learning, using python as a tool is efficient because because of its flexibility, readability, and vast array of libraries and tools available  Data wrangling, also known as data pre-processing, is a critical step in machine learning, as it involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data before it is fed into a machine learning model. The quality of the input data is a key determinant of the accuracy and reliability of the machine learning model, so data wrangling plays a crucial role in the success of the model.       Here are some of the ways data wrangling is significant in machine learning:  Handling missing values: Data often contains missing values, which can cause errors or bias in the analysis. Data wrangling involves identifying and handling missing values by either removing the rows with missing values, filling in the missing values using imputation methods, or using machine learning models that can handle missing values.  Encoding categorical variables: Categorical variables are variables that take on a limited number of discrete values, such as gender or colour. Machine learning models typically require numerical inputs, so data wrangling involves encoding categorical variables using methods such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. From this task, I have managed to encode the ‘diagnosis’ column into binary digits.  Feature scaling: Different features in the data may have different scales or ranges, which can cause some machine learning models to perform poorly. Data wrangling involves scaling the features to a common range, such as min-max scaling or standardization, to ensure that the machine learning model is not biased towards certain features.  Handling outliers: Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data, and they can have a large impact on the analysis. Data wrangling involves identifying and handling outliers using methods such as removing them, transforming them, or using robust machine learning models that are less sensitive to outliers.  Feature selection: Not all features in the data may be relevant or useful for the machine learning model. Data wrangling involves selecting the most important features using methods such as correlation analysis, feature importance ranking, or domain knowledge.  Overall, data wrangling is significant in machine learning because it helps ensure that the data is clean, relevant, and properly formatted for analysis, which can ultimately lead to more accurate and reliable machine learning models.
