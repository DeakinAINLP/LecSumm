The main topic of topic 2 is about the Data wrangling and the fundamental mathematical concepts which are applying for Data wrangling. In addition usage of Python programming (with some sample codes) for Data wrangling.  The mathematical concepts are being discussed are “vectors and its basic vector operations”,” matrices “and “ concept of probability”.  Mainly I gain my knowledge on concept of Data wrangling and  how to use Python  on Data wrangling
