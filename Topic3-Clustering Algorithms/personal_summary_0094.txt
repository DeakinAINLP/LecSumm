Mathematics and ML  -  ML is based on math  o  Math underlies every decision, iteration and output.  ▪  Key areas include:    Vectors and basic vector operations   Matrices and matrix operations   Probability   Python programming: utilizing different packages and modules  Statistics  -  Coin toss:  -  Dice roll:  Probability  -  The likelihood of an event occurring is quantified between number 0 and 1 -  P(A) = 1 – P(A)  Joint probability  -  Toss two coins: P(A&B) = P(A)P(B)  -  Conditional Probability  -  Probability of some event A, given the occurance of another event B  - -  Provided B != 0  Bayes Rule  -  Probability of event A based on another event B that is related to A -  e.g., if cancer is related to age – using Bayes’ rule information about a person’s age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that the person may have cancer  -  Random Variables  -  Function that can assign probabilities to events of interest in a random experiment  - -  A random variable can assign a probability to all possible outcomes on a random experiment  Two types  1.  Discrete random variables – have a countable number of values e.g., faces of die, number of  emails  a.  Defined using a PMF (Probability Mass Functions) denoted as b.  Cumulative Distribution Function(CDF)  c.  Seeing number greater than 5 (dice roll) =  2.  Continuous random variables – can take values on an infinite continuum; persons height, time to  failure  a.  Defined using Probability Density Functions (PDF), denoted as f(x). b.  PDF is a statistical expression that defines a probability distribution for a continuous  random variable  c.  PDF assigns a probability to a range of values of the random variable as:  d. e.  Therefore;  f.  Distributions of random variables  -  A function that links each outcome of a statistical experiment with its probability of occurrences  Bernoulli distribution  -  Discrete distribution for a binary random variable with values X = 0 & X = 1  -  Uniform distribution  -  Can be defined for both discrete and continuous random variables -  For a discrete random variable:  - -  For a continuous random variable:  -  Normal distribution  -  For a continuous random variable, defined as:  - -  ^ most popular distribution (bell curve)  Central limit theorem  -  If you have a population with and take a sufficiently large random samples from the existing population, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed  -  The distribution of random variables becomes increasingly normal (Gaussian) as N grows:  Data Wrangling  -  Process of data cleaning, transforming and organizing a dataset to make it suitable for analysis,  involves a combination of manual and automated processes  -  Common tasks include:  Identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in the data  o o  Handling missing or incomplete data o  Combining multiple datasets o  Converting the data into a format that is suitable for analysis o o  Normalizing the data o  Aggregating the data into useful summary statistics  Identifying and removing outliers  -  Integral part of data science process – allows you to transform raw unstructured data into a form suitable for analysis and insights  Images as data  -  How to identify an image as indoors or outdoors?  o  Create a set of programming instructions (algorithm) to process each picture and make a decision, the greater the sample size the more accurate the results and therefore the machine has learned.  -  Computers understand numbers; therefore find features that can be represented as numbers -  An image needs to be represented in a numerical vector of features; the algorithm will only be  able to understand the image if you can feed the image in as a set of numbers  Creating a model  -  Have to decide how to represent an image numerically; start by diving the image into smaller  9x15 = 135 blocks  - -  For each block, we can compute features of our choice for example:  o  Colour averages across the block o  Shapes within the block – number of straight lines, curves etc o  Texture for example the amount of light/dark variation in the block o  Radiance or brightness -  For these 135 blocks we can compute:  o  Mean o  Variance o  Other statistics  -  Lets say we extracted p features per block = 135p per image; therefore for n images, the size of  the feature matrix is 135p * n  -  This photo has 135 blocks, if we had 1000 images to sort and have selected four features to  analyse. The feature matrix is 135 * 1000 * 4  -  Having turned the image into a set of numbers the resulting feature matrix can be fed into a  proper computer algorithm for classification into indoor or outdoor  Text data representation  -  Computers only understand numeric values; therefore machine learning requires data to be  represented by ‘features’ called attributes or parameters  Bag-of-word representation  Signal  -  Refers to a sign or gesture conveying certain information -  X is the independent variable, f is the dependent variable  -  Encoding and Distribution  Encoding  -  Numeric value to represent features of a dataset; e.g., burwood: information technology = 0.2,  while warrun ponds: life and environmental studies would be = 1.3  Distribution  -  Refers to the way the values in a  dataset are distributed -  Normal distributon = bell curve -  Uniform distribution – one where the values are evenly distributed cross the range of data -  Skewed distribution – valoules are not evenly distributed and are concentrated on one side of the  range  Studying heights in cm of a few students:  H = height of each student  N = total student number  Scaling  -  Refers to the process of converting a set of values to a new range of values; e.g., height in feet and weight in pounds the weight will dominate the model more than height and not ideal for optimal results; therefore we need to scale both features in a certain range  Normalisation  -  Scaling technique used to transform values of dataset into a common range – improves  performance of machine learning algorithms  -  One common method is to scale the data to a range of 0 to 1; 0 = minimum value and 1 is max;  this is also known as min-max normalization:   Improves performance of many algorithms by standardizing data  Data wrangling with python  Random variables  Discrete random variables  - -  Output:  Cumulative Distribution Fcuntion (CDF)  -  Provides us with the cumulative probability associated with a function:  - -  Output:  Data wrangling  -  Procedure of acquiring, analyzing and manipulating raw data into a suitable format -  Can be divided into the following sections: o  Data loading and saving o  Data exploration o  Data processing o  Data distribution o  Scaling  Random data into pandas dataframe  - -  Output:
