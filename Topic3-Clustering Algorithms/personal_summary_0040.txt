LESSON REVIEW: I’ve been a software developer for 20+ years and have used and continue to use many of the methods that are now considered “machine learning” or “artificial intelligence”. My current position is Systems Architect for ML & AI at Certified Collectables Group and I design and implement end to end ML/AI solutions to automate the identification, classification & grading of collectables. So this topic I learnt nothing new.  Again, I did discover quiz questions that are poorly worded and/or just plain wrong. e.g.  The pandas filna() function requires either a fill value or the fill method, so with no arguments what happens is you get an exception. And what happens if you provide either a fill value or fill method clearly depends on what argument you provide.  SUMMARY OF THE MAIN POINTS FOR TOPIC 2 LEARNING:  This topics learning covered the absolute bare minimum pre-requisite knowledge and skills I’d expect a student to already have even to take this class.   Basic python, numpy, pandas etc.  Basic probability and statistics: events, joint and conditional probability, bayes rule, discrete  and continuous random variables, some common distributions, bernoulli, normal etc.  Concepts of “data wrangling”, loading, saving data, scaling, normalization, dealing with  missing values etc.   Working with data frames in pandas to perform data analysis and exploration.  Data representation, encoding, feature extraction.   Some examples of how the above i.e. how to wrangle data, perform basic statistical computations, plot graphs etc with numpy, matplotlib, pandas etc.
