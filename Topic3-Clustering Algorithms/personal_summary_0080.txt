 Machine learning heavily relies on mathematics. In data science and machine  learning, concepts such as vectors, matrices, and probability are frequently  used.  Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, transforming, and aggregating raw  data for analysis. This can include tasks such as handling missing data,  removing duplicates, and converting data types  As computers can only understand numbers, things such as images and text must be converted into numerical values. This requires decisions to be made as to how the data will be represented, such as word frequency or mean colour value.  Encoding data is a way to represent categorical variables as numerical values. This is important for machine learning algorithms, which require numerical inputs. Common encoding techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, and binary encoding  Distribution in data is how the data is distributed in a dataset. These could be skewed to one side, normal (bell curve), or uniform (even across the dataset).  The distribution of data can affect the performance of an algorithm, such as creating a bias towards certain types of data.  Scaling involves normalizing the values of  features to be similar to that of other features. This can improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by  avoiding biases or greater impact of some features over others.
