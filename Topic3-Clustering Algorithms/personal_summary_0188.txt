1.)  Summary of points covered:   Vectors  o  Assign values for mapping o  Discrete  ▪  Countable WHOLE numbers. ▪  PMF; Probability Mass function  o  Continuous  ▪  Ex. 10.32, 1.44. ▪  PDF; Probability density function    Matrices   Probability  o  An event as a set of outcomes of a random experiment o  Probability b/w 0 and 1 o  P(A)… (A=event) o Joint Probability  ▪  Coin toss example. ▪  P(A)P(B)    Two events jointly  o  Conditional ▪ o  Bayes Rule  “P(A) given the outcome P(B)”  ▪  New outcomes change existing beliefs ▪  Can predict an outcome based on prior information    Distribution of random variables  o  Bernoulli distribution  ▪  Discrete ▪  Binary ▪  Noted by Bernoulli symbol B ▪  Ex. Yes/no, Pass/Fail, Male/Female  o  Uniform distribution  ▪  Both discrete and continuous random variables ▪  “N” in discrete variables is replaced by “a,b” in continuous random variable  o  Normal Distribution  ▪  Continuous random variables ▪  Most popular because there is tendency in natural phenomena to follow normal  distributions  o  Central Limit theorem  ▪  As N grows, variables become increasingly normal, following a Gaussian  distribution. Involves Mean and Standard deviation. Large population sample Independent and identically distributed.  ▪ ▪ ▪    Data Wrangling  o  Cleaning, Transforming, and organising data o  Ability to be analysed o  Correct format of data  o  Removing outlier o  Handling/replace missing values o  Combining data sets o  Summary statistics o  Normalising and scaling data  ▪  Makes Data comparable    Feature extraction  o  Deriving a feature from raw data (Numerical)  ▪  This feature provides information on the target variable  o  In terms of image  ▪  Each feature in a box that has been derived from an image ▪  Ex. Differentiating between an image taken inside/outside    Each image separated into blocks that identifies features within. these  could be, colours, brightness, lines/curves.    Each box produces statistics on these features, such as mean.    Encoding  o  Convert into numerical integer values. o  Can code by features. Locations represented in integers, other categories into more  integers. Combinations of these given integer labels can provide in detail descriptions including subcategories = no compromising of Information.
