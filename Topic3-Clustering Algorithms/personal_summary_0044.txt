 This  topic  I  learned  that  machine  learning  is  a  fascinating  field  that  uses  math  and  computer techniques  to  teach  machines  to  learn  from  data  without  being  told  what  to  do  explicitly.  To  use machine  learning  algorithms  well,  I  must  grasp statistics,  data  wrangling,  data  representation,  and data exploration well. In addition, we touched base on random variables and their types. I learned basic statistical concepts like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation and probability distributions like the Uniform, Bernoulli, and normal distributions and learned about the significance of the z-score in scaling data for improved performance.  Data wrangling is essential to machine learning, so I need to know how to clean and transform raw data  into  something  I  can  analyse.  This  includes  removing  outliers,  handling  missing  data,  and transforming variables to make them suitable for analysis.  I  also  learned  that  images  and  text  could  be  used  as  data  for  machine  learning.  In  the  section  on images, I learned about techniques like resizing, cropping, and normalisation to prepare images for analysis. I discovered techniques for representing text data, like bag-of-words and word embeddings, in the text data representation section. Feature extraction is another essential process that involves selecting and transforming the relevant features from data to use in machine learning algorithms. I learned  about  techniques  for  feature  extraction,  like  principal  component  analysis  and  linear discriminant analysis.  In the data vs signal section, I learned about the differences between these two types of information and how they are used in machine learning. Encoding and distribution are critical parts of preparing data  for  use  in  machine  learning.  This  involves  techniques  like  one-hot  encoding  and  probability distributions. Scaling and normalisation are also essential steps in data preparation, as they involve transforming data to a consistent scale and distribution.  Python is a popular programming language for machine learning, and I learned about data wrangling with  Python,  including  techniques  for  performing  data  wrangling  tasks  using  Python  libraries  like pandas and NumPy. I also learned that statistics are crucial in data science, enabling scientists to test hypotheses  and  analyse  regression.  Getting  hands-on  experience  with  the  pandas  package  during topicly tasks was crucial to my learning experience. As a result, I now understand how pandas can be used for data preprocessing, data exploration, feature engineering, model evaluation, and loading and saving  files.  Additionally,  I've  learned  about  different  types  of  data  representation,  including converting image data into matrices of smaller blocks.  A solid Python foundation has been an enormous asset in my machine-learning journey. I can quickly adapt  basic  operations  and  other  core  components,  such  as  Python  packages,  which  are  highly beneficial  in  machine  learning.  This  will  help  me  complete  assignments  promptly  and  execute professional work more efficiently.
