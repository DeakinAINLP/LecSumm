The activities this topic mainly covered how to use different data wrangling techniques to prepare data. To complete the activities this topic we used the Python pandas library to analyse and manipulate datasets. The task involved handling missing values in the dataset, converting categorical variables into a more appropriate data-type, and normalising data. I mainly used the pandas documentation (http://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/) to find information on using different DataFrame methods (mostly arguments and indexing the DataFrame object itself).  After the content of this topic I feel much more confident in using pandas to manipulate datasets using python (both the manual and automatic manipulation of data). Additionally, I feel like I learned a lot from the data wrangling sections as the preparation of data is not something I have done much in the past.  I had some difficulties with this topics quiz as it involves some libraries that I didnâ€™t have much knowledge on.
