In this topic lecture we learn about the basic of statistics and learn that probability plays an important role in machine learning. A few things that defines probability better are random experiments whoâ€™s output can be predicted like toss coin, roll of dice, daily temperature etc , events , probability, joint probability, conditional probability and bayes rule. We also get the knowledge about random variables that a random variable is w variable whose possible values are the generated outcomes of a random phenomenon. a random variable is a function that can assign probabilities to events of interest in a random experiment. Working with random variables we usually deal with are discrete variables which are defined using probability mass function(PMF) and continuous random variables which are defined using probability density function(PDF). We further study about the distribution of random variables and its types which are bernoulli distribution , uniform distribution , normal distribution and normal distribution. We learn about data wangling and also learn to use it in our coding and how important it is in the field of machine learning. To to explore more about the topics we learn in this topic I rewatched the lecture to learn if i have missed any point then further i took practical workshop to brung my knowledge into practical practice. Moreover i used google scholars and youtube to get more know knowledge.
