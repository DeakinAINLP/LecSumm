  Machine learning involves using statistical models to analyze and interpret data, including the use of random variables whose values are determined by the outcome of a random process.   Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for analysis, while images and text can be represented as data and feature extraction is used to select relevant features.   Encoding and distribution are used to represent data in specific formats and distribute it, and scaling and normalization techniques are used to transform data into a common scale or distribution.   Statistics is fundamental to data science, enabling the analysis and interpretation of large and complex datasets through techniques such as data exploration, visualization, and statistical models.   Data loading and saving are critical components of data analysis and machine learning, involving reading and writing data to and from storage devices.   Statistics plays a significant role in machine learning and data science, allowing the interpretation and analysis of data to make informed decisions and predictions.   Techniques such as feature extraction, scaling, and normalization prepare data for analysis, while data exploration and loading and saving are essential steps in analyzing and accessing data.
